<p><u>Parent Communication Guidelines</u>
</p>
<p>At Evergreen Primary School, we value our partnership with parents. Clear
and timely communication supports our shared goal of enabling students
to learn and develop well. The following will outline our communication
practices.</p>
<p><u>Contacting Teachers</u>
</p>
<p>Parents may contact teachers during the school term from 7:30 AM to 5:00
PM, Mondays to Fridays, via email or telephone.</p>
<p>As teachers will be engaged in lessons and school duties throughout the
day, calls are likely to be returned at the end of their duties. Messages
received outside school hours, on weekends, public holidays, or during
school holidays will be replied to during the next school day.</p>
<p><u>Teacher Email Addresses</u>
</p>
<p>At the beginning of each academic year, parents will receive the email
addresses of their child’s Form Teachers and subject teachers. Parents
may email teachers directly for matters relating to their child’s learning,
behaviour, or well-being.</p>
<p><u>Urgent Matters</u>
</p>
<p>For urgent matters during school hours, parents should contact our General
Office at 6368 7705.</p>
<p><u>Scheduling Meetings with Teachers</u>
</p>
<p>Parents who wish to meet with a teacher may email the teacher directly
for an appointment.</p>
<p>To support smooth scheduling and minimize disruption to lessons, parents
are encouraged to make their appointment requests at least three working
days in advance. Teachers will propose a meeting time based on their timetable
and responsibilities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<u>Email Response Timeframe</u>
</p>
<p>To ensure that queries are addressed appropriately, the school uses the
following general guidelines:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 working days – General queries</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 working days – Queries requiring
follow-up or investigation</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21 working days – Queries involving
greater complexity</p>
<p>Actual response times may vary depending on the nature of the query and
teachers’ schedules. Teachers will prioritize teaching and student-related
matters during the school day.</p>
<p>We value respectful and constructive communication. The school may choose
not to engage with or respond to messages that are disrespectful, rude,
or abusive.</p>
<p><u>Partnership Commitment</u>
