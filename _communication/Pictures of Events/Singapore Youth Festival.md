# **Singapore Youth Festival**

### SYF - ILLUMINATE@KAMPONG ADMIRALTY

Our EGPS students and teachers spent their Sunday productively, by representing the school in the SYF celebrations which were held at Kampong Admiralty.  

Dancers from the Chinese, Indian and Malay CCAs put up vibrant and colourful perfomances, culminating in a fusion dance incorporating all 3 dances.

Our International Drumming students, armed with the skills picked up from their MMP session, put up an exciting and energetic performance, inviting the audience to participate in their routine.

Our T.G.I.F. and Art Lab groups were also present to showcase the activities that we have been doing in school. Guided ably by the teachers in charge, they explained and facilitated the activities for visitors to their booth.

It was indeed a engaging and wonderful learning experience for both our students and the visitors who got to know more about our school and its P.L.A.Y. approach.

Well done everybody!
