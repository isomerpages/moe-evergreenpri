	<b><u>Why you should make EGPS your school of choice</u></b>
</center>
	
Established in 1999, EGPS has always provided programmes for the holistic development of every student. In 2017, as part of the school’s re-envisioning, P.L.A.Y was conceptualised. This was in tandem with MOE’s direction of developing greater Joy in Learning in our schools. &nbsp;

***"The science tells us that having the time &amp; space for your mind to wander when you are young is critical in developing creative abilities…we need to provide a diversity of experiences for children as they grow up outside of classrooms…allow them to pursue their passions and develop special talents."***

**_~Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, NTU Lecture 2017_**

<u>What is the P.L.A.Y. approach?</u>

**Positivity in Relationships**

Developing positive relationships is fundamental in EGPS. The students adopt **Think Good, Speak Good and DO Good as a way of life**.  Students display the school values of Empathy, Respect &amp; Graciousness through their interactions with their teachers, CCA instructors, staff and peers. Activities and programmes are designed specifically to instill values and sound character in our students. Good behaviour is highlighted during termly celebrations such as **Let’s Celebrate**, and students are encouraged to learn more about each others’ cultures, races and practices via the festive celebrations. The school also places importance in fostering positive relationships with our Parents Support Group members and external collaborators such as foreign visitors. 

**Learning with Passion**

Learning is not confined within the 4 walls of the classroom in EGPS. To achieve **Joy in Learning**, our niche programmes such as T.G.I.F &amp; MMP are conducted in EGPS on a termly basis over 9 weeks. Through MMP, students are exposed to a variety of experiences and skills so that they can discover their talents and interests in the process.  These programmes allow our students to participate and learn new knowledge/skills which they then synthesize with their learning in classrooms. They also help to uncover and rekindle their interest in non-academic areas, which can then be used to embark on a life-long journey of learning. Learning journeys for all levels are also utilized as a means for our students to experience subject knowledge first-hand and immerse themselves in the rich history of their shared environment. The school also has a wide variety of CCAs for students to take part in and students who excel in these CCAs are selected for the school team which takes part in external competitions.

**Actively Contributing**

Every student has a part to play in the betterment of the school.  A **Culture of Care** is also a theme which is widely prevalent in EGPS. Every student is given opportunities to play their part to make their class, level and school a better place to be. Students participate in charity drives throughout the year such as the TTSH Hongbao drive so that they can practice Empathy and Graciousness for others in society. In line with the vision of Every Student a Leader, student leaders also have the chance to learn about Respect and Graciousness as they step into their leadership journey. Student leaders for the role of Head and Deputy Head are voted by all staff and students from primary 2 -6.  The Student Leaders’ Investiture is a formal ceremony where our appointed leaders undertake a pledge to serve the school and their peers, witnessed by their parents. Another milestone event for all students is the P5 Camp where our students come together as a level, learning from each other and working together to achieve the desired outcomes. At the end of 6 years, every P6 student will do an Art piece to Pay it Forward to the school and leave a piece of themselves behind as they graduate.  Every cohort’s Art piece is proudly displayed on the walls each year. 

**Youthfulness in Living**

At EGPS, staff and students are encouraged to be as creative as they can be. By tapping on their strengths and interests and working together as a team.  Our students and staff exercise their **Choice and Voice** to bring about changes that they deem beneficial. A positive mindset is an enabler for EGPS students to approach learning and building of life experiences with **Passion and Purpose**. As such, the school adopts Environment as a 3rd teacher and learning is everywhere.  The school values of Grit and Integrity ensures that our students make decisions which are in line with the ethos of our school, and make EGPS a happy school where there is Joy in Learning and our students, Pure in Act.
