	<b><u>Why you should make EGPS your school of choice</u></b>
</center>
	
Established in 1999, EGPS has always provided programmes for the holistic development of every student. In 2017, as part of the school’s re-envisioning, P.L.A.Y was conceptualised. This was in tandem with MOE’s direction of developing greater Joy in Learning in our schools. &nbsp;

***"The science tells us that having the time &amp; space for your mind to wander when you are young is critical in developing creative abilities…we need to provide a diversity of experiences for children as they grow up outside of classrooms…allow them to pursue their passions and develop special talents."***

**_~Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, NTU Lecture 2017_**
