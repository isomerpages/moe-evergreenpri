What is DSA-Sec?
----------------

 DSA-Sec allows P6 students to apply to some secondary schools before taking the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).

They can apply based on their talent in sports, arts, academic areas, etc.

*   Submit school choices during the Secondary 1 (S1) posting process.
*   Transfer to another school. They **must** commit to their chosen school for the duration of the programme.
