# **PLAY Approach**

![](/images/PLAY.jpg)

All our school plans and programmes are aligned to **P.L.A.Y.**  
  
**Positivity in Relationships, Learning with Passion, Actively Contributing** and **Youthfulness in Living**
  
We have purposefully integrated P.L.A.Y through programmes like Learn for Life in the Arts (LLP) and Multi-modal Programme (MMP). We hope that our students will find the _Joy in Learning_ as they interact positively with each other and discover new learning experiences and even in their young age, to be _Pure to Act_ in their thoughts, speech and action to influence their homes, school and community.
