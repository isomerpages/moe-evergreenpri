<h1><strong>Present</strong></h1>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Punctuality is a habit that must be instilled
from young.&nbsp; Students must be in school during term time unless they
are unwell.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must be punctual for school
and for all school functions. Students are to assemble in school by 7.15
a.m. at the respective assembly areas. Flag raising will be conducted at
7.30 a.m. sharp.&nbsp; Any student who arrives later than 7.30 a.m. will
be considered late.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a student is late 4 times or more
per semester, he/she will be issued letter of advice.&nbsp; The Conduct
Grade will be affected for those who are constantly late and disciplinary
action will be taken against these students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are not allowed to leave the
school compound during curriculum hours without permission. This includes
those who are attending after-school activities in the afternoon (e.g.
CCA, Enrichment, Remedial, Supplementary, LSP) and are not allowed to leave
the school premise until such activities have ended. Prior permission should
be obtained if the child is required to leave during school hours.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regular attendance is essential in
achieving effective teaching and learning, the opportunity for learning
and growth is lost when the students do not attend school or are late for
school.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure students’ presence in school
is consistent for learning, the school will keep track of students with
a prevalent VR (private) record by having a policy that will <u>not allow for more than five parent letters per term</u>,
per student.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are expected to attend school
for the full duration of the school term.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student must understand the
purpose of rules in instilling discipline and maintaining safety in the
school. There must be uniformity in appearance when students come to school.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform for all school activities
(Please refer to photos for examples of school attire).&nbsp; No modification
to the school uniform is allowed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students’ attire must be neat and
tidy at all times.&nbsp; Every student must have their name tags sewn on
their uniform.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Girls with long hair (longer than
the collar) must have it tied neatly in a ponytail or in plaits.&nbsp;
Long fringe must be pulled back with a hair band or hair clip. Only black
hair accessories are accepted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Girls are not allowed to wear make-up
including lining their eyes with eyeliner or kohl.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nails are to be kept clean and
short at all times. Nail polish and henna are not allowed.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boys must have short and acceptable
hairstyle.&nbsp; Boys are not allowed to shave closely to the scalp on
one side and have longer fringe on the other side. No other fanciful haircuts
are allowed.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boys must be clean shaven and neat
in appearance. &nbsp;Facial hair including beards and moustaches is prohibited.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disciplinary action will be taken
against students who continuously break the rules despite counselling and
reminders sent. Parents are to ensure that the student appears with acceptable
hairstyle during term time for uniformity.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No coloured dye is to be applied
to the hair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; No jewellery must be worn to school.&nbsp; Only plain
ear studs (black, gold or silver) are allowed.&nbsp; For safety reasons,
girls are not allowed to wear loop ear rings as they may pose a danger
during play.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; The school must be a safe place for everyone.&nbsp; Hence,
all students are not allowed to have in their possession any weapon or
to bring any weapon-like item which is used or intended to be used to cause
harm to others. Students need not bring personal scissors or pen knife
to school as the school will provide for them when necessary.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unauthorized electronic, communication, entertainment
or gaming devices capable of capturing, storing, displaying and/or transmitting
visual, audio or verbal information are not allowed in the school compound
regardless of the time of the day. Examples of prohibited items include
mobile phones, cameras, tablets and smart wrist watches.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
school will not be held responsible for the loss of students’ electronic
devices.&nbsp; Unauthorized use of electronic devices will be confiscated
and will only be returned to the student’s parent/guardian.&nbsp;</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are not allowed to bring mobile phones and wear
smart watches to school.&nbsp; If students need to bring their mobile phones/smart
watches due to emergencies at home, permission must be sought from Form
Teacher.&nbsp; The phone/watch must be switched off and be used only upon
dismissal.&nbsp; The student must be responsible in taking care of his
/ her own belongings.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that POSB watches are
allowed.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a teacher has authorized the use of electronic devices
for educational purposes, students are expected to use them responsibly
and in compliance with the school’s anti-bullying and anti-cyberbullying
policies. Students must not photograph, video, record or post on social
media of students or staff members without permission.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are not allowed to have in their possession any
weapon. They are also not allowed to bring any weapon-like item which is
intended to be used to cause harm to others.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every EGPS student will adhere to the school motto to
be <strong>Pure in Act</strong>. Students are to learn good habits and exercise
the right values at all times. They must respect themselves, their peers,
teachers and school property at all times.&nbsp; The school advocates, <strong>Think Good, Do Good, and Speak Good</strong> at
all times.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a school community we will exercise care and respect
for one another.&nbsp; There is Zero Tolerance for bullying at EGPS.&nbsp;
Bullying includes physical, psychological and cyber bullying. The school
will mediate and counsel students involved in bullying.&nbsp; The school
will take serious actions against students who repeatedly hurt others despite
counselling, mediation and warning.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp; The school has a case management process in place and
students who do not adhere to school rules will be meted with the appropriate
consequences.&nbsp; Parents are requested to work closely with the school
so that we educate every student to take responsibility for their own actions.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Passion</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All students must participate in
the flag-raising and pledge taking ceremony at the start of the day.&nbsp;
Students who are Singapore Citizens must sing the National Anthem and take
the National Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with the right fist
over the heart while reciting the Pledge to show commitment and pride.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For every child to find meaning
in his/her learning he/she must be passionate about learning. He/she must
be proud to be a student of EGPS and be passionate about learning the academics
as well as values and social emotional competencies.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must be committed to their
holistic learning.&nbsp; The process of learning is as important as the
product.&nbsp; Hence, every student must complete all homework, worksheets
and corrections assigned by the teacher dutifully and handed in on time.&nbsp;
They must use the student diary to manage their assignments and time well.&nbsp;
Parents are to help monitor that their child is completing all work assigned
on time.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must learn the habit of
organising their daily work so that everything is in order for their revision
purpose.&nbsp; All worksheets must be neatly files in the respective subject
files and handed to the teacher for checking when required to.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Perform</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school provides a holistic
development program for our students.&nbsp; Every EGPS student will be
confident and self-directed in his/her learning.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of every co-curricular
program, students will be required to perform / share their learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This can be in the form of performance,
oral/written presentation, publication or reflection.&nbsp; This is aligned
to the school’s approach in developing confidence and commitment in every
student.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students who have opted for CCA,
must attend every session unless written permission is sought from CCA
teacher.&nbsp; Any student who fails to maintain 75% attendance, will be
dropped from the respective CCAs and will not be awarded certificate of
participation.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student will be provided
opportunity and skills to be a leader.&nbsp; Leadership opportunities will
be provided in a tiered approach.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must adopt an excellence
mind-set and do the best that they can.&nbsp; They must challenge themselves
to realise their potential.&nbsp; Every student must set academic and character
goals every year to work towards their individual purpose. They will be
closely monitored and coached throughout the year so that they can reach
their optimal best.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remedial lessons will only be catered
to students who really need the assistance for closer coaching. Parents
are to ensure that their child attends the remedial lessons if they have
been selected for them.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are encouraged to act
responsibly by taking ownership in packing their bags every day and bringing
the necessary books/materials to school. Parents/domestic helpers are discouraged
from delivering any items to our students during school hours so as to
allow them the opportunity to learn and be more responsible. Such acts
also causes disruption and additional work for our Office Staff and the
school reserves the right to not accede to such requests.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must exercise Integrity
during all tests/examinations. Students are considered to have cheated
tests/examinations when they are found:&nbsp;</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copying from another student or allowing
another student to copy via various forms of communication that include
verbal/non-verbal gestures, display of writing materials; retrieving information
by any electronic means that include computerised wrist watches, mobile
phones, digital cameras etc&nbsp; (list is not exhaustive)</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attempting to amend marks or change answers
on marked exam scripts</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any student who has cheated or attempted to cheat,
or collaborated with others with the intention to cheat, will have to go
through School Exam Board’s investigations.&nbsp; If found guilty, severe
actions will be taken against all students involved.&nbsp; Decision by
school is final.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>School Rules and Consequences</h3>
<p>The school believes that good discipline is an important contributing
factor towards creating an effective school. Our discipline policies and
procedures foster self-discipline and desired behaviours that are aligned
to our school values. The following serves as a guide and depending on
the severity of the offences, appropriate disciplinary action/s will be
meted out in consultation with the School Leaders and Key Personnel in-charge
of discipline matters.</p>
<p>If students violate the school rules and need to be disciplined, the school
seeks the understanding of parents and guardians to support the Student
Development Team (SDT) when disciplinary actions are administered.</p>
