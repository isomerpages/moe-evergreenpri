# **Principal's Message**

<img src="/images/principal.jpeg" style="width:80%">

**Welcome to 2023**

      
In line with the school’s vision of building **A Vibrant School that which inspires Passion in Learning and Purposeful Living,** we would like to create joyful learning experiences that will make the learner be more engaged and empowered so that he can be self-directed and innovative. We will continue to be guided by our mission of P.L.A.Y. and our school values of Respect, Empathy, Graciousness, Grit and Integrity.

Any visitor walking into the school compound will be greeted by **EGPS Wheel of Social Mobility**.  On the wall you will see Our Pledge of Inclusion that reads,

**Our Pledge of Inclusion**

_Every staff @EGPS believes in creating an inclusive culture that embraces all learners. We **recognize differences as assets and celebrate diversity as strengths.** No matter what background, characteristics, interests, and learning styles, **every child that walks through the gates of EGPS is valued, respected, and accepted.** **We recognize the desire of pursuing dreams and aspirations as a birth right**. Our staff is committed to providing enriching experiences that aggregate towards Learning for Life. We pledge to journey with our students in honing their knowledge, skills and dispositions in various domains, developing passion and talents while harnessing their strengths to overcome challenges._

**…………………………………………………………………………………**

We, the Staff of Evergreen Primary<br>
Embrace all learners without partiality<br>
Regardless of class, status and background<br>
Equal opportunities adorn our PLAYground<br>
Inclusive learning with exclusive experiences<br>
Every dream is built without exceptions<br>
Learning for Life to Learning from Life<br>
We journey with you through every strife<br>
To build a school of one of a kind<br>
Nobody but memories are left behind<br>

The Pledge written by our staff, encapsulates our beliefs and commitment in developing every student at EGPS. We leverage on the school’s Mission of P.L.A.Y. which is **Positivity in Relationships, Learning with Passion, Actively Contributing and Youthfulness in Living**.  Our Innovative programmes. include **_Multi-Modal Programmes (MMP) and That’s Great It’s Friday (TGIF)_** which aim to provide our pupils with a Choice and Voice.  P.L.A.Y. allows children to explore uncharted waters and learn social skills in a non-threatening environment.  We aim to provide our students the platforms to uncover their strengths and interests through these innovative programmes. Moreover, through the MMP, confidence will be developed as every programme will culminate in either a performance or sharing by every student yearly. 

All learning, both within the Core Curriculum or Co-curriculum, will be captured in the Student Portfolio so that every student of EGPS will leave the school with a holistic portfolio developed over their 6 years in the school.  The school’s signature programme, Multi-Modal Program (MMP) exposes every student to **6 Areas of Enrichment (19 modules over 6 years) that include Story telling, Musical, Novelty Sports, Drumming etc.**  We are affirmed by parents and partner secondary schools that our students have developed to be more confident and have greater self-esteem and self-efficacy because of their holistic development in the various domains. Over the years from 2019, we have a high number of students who have qualified to the secondary school of their choice through DSA.

The school’s **Learning for Life Prog (Aesthetics)** and **Applied Learning Prog (STEM) are the other 2 signature programmes that are unique to EGPS.**  You will be able to get a better understanding of what these are through our website.

At EGPS, many programs are conducted for ALL students.  All student programmes will be tiered through our **_3 S Approach: Stretch, Strengthen and Support_** so that while no one is left behind, those who need the extra push will be given the necessary opportunities to excel and shine. We have a very comprehensive 4 tiered Leadership development programme for all students as well.

EGPS has built a very vibrant culture by creating learning spaces beyond the classroom guided by the principle of **Environment as the 3rd Teacher**. Story House (Library), Arts Carousel (Arts Corridor), iWonder (Innovation Hub) and the PLAY Room (Multi-purpose Classroom for MMP, PAL & Art lessons) are some of the few learning spaces that have been newly created over the last 3 to 5 years.  The thematic murals in the Pri 1 and 2 classrooms have also enhanced the learning environment to be more vibrant.  The school will continue to create more authentic spaces for students to be engaged in learning beyond the classroom.

Mrs See, the first Principal of EGPS, wrote this in her inaugural issue of the school newsletter in 2001; “**_Each child is an opportunity, each child is a promise_**”.  Till to date, EGPS has lived out its promise to maximize the potential of every student irrespective of their entry point into the school.  What we take greater pride in is the values and dispositions that our students display.  The school’s strong emphasis on “**Think Good, Speak Good and Do Good**” has translated to students being more respectful, displaying empathy and showing more graciousness in their daily lives.

The students are our pride, our hope our future.

Have a purposeful and fulfilling year ahead!
