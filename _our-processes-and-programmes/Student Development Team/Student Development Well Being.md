Student Development Well-Being
==============================

![](/images/SDWB.jpg) 

At Evergreen Primary, we strive to create a caring and enabling environment for our students. We believe that every child is a peer supporter. Peer bonding, peer helping and peer influencing are some of the ways that students learn to make friends, help each other and stand up for each other.   

Every year, zero-bullying week serves to reinforce the zero-tolerance policy for bullying in the school. Through the programmes, students learn to be upstanders and practise empathy by taking perspectives of the bullies and the victims.  

They also practise using kind words. When they understand the impact of their words and actions, students will be in a better place to make good decisions before they act.
