**Student Development &amp; Well-Being**
===========================================

**Vision**

A school where students grow to develop good character, resilience and a strong national identity.

**Mission**

To inculcate desired shared values and equip our students with the social and emotional competencies to develop a sense of purpose and citizenship dispositions to enable them to grow holistically, leading to positive life outcomes.
Approach

**1.	Total Curriculum @ EGPS**<br><br>
At EGPS, we aim to provide a robust, holistic and innovative programme through our curriculum and co-curriculum. We want every student to be provided with varied learning experiences in different domains of the curriculum that include, Language Arts, Aesthetics, Sports, Entrepreneurship Skills, Media and Technology and Lifeskills over the six years in our school. We hope that through these experiences every student will be able to develop their competencies in the different subject matters, discover their strengths and interests and be developed into confident students. 

**2.	A Caring and Enabling School Environment**<br><br>
A caring and enabling environment aims to help students feel safe, accepted, empowered, and competent. As a school, we recognised that we play a crucial role in establishing and sustaining these efforts.
At EGPS, we put in place systems, policies and structures for positive and proactive discipline and provide a continuum of care to meet the diverse needs of our students. 
Through P.L.A.Y, we aim to build positive relationships between teachers and students and amongst students. We also demonstrate a consistent and coherent messaging emanating from the schoolâ€™s VMV and direction to our programmes and daily practices with our students. 




# **Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE)**

<br>
<br>

The goal of CCE is to inculcate values and build competencies in our students. Through the CCE curriculum and key student development experiences, our students will learn to be responsible individuals towards self, family, and community; understand their roles in shaping the future of our nation. 

1.	**CCE Curriculum**

The CCE syllabus provides the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes to be taught explicitly through the CCE Curriculum. The CCE Curriculum comprises of the following:

**(a)	CCE (FTGP)**

CCE (FTGP) lessons are conducted by Form Teachers and it involves the explicit teaching and learning of fundamental social-emotional skills which are anchored on values and citizenship dispositions. 

**(b)	CCE (MTL)**

CCE (MTL) lessons are conducted by Mother Tongue Language teachers and  through the curriculum, students get to deepen the learning of moral values through cultural stories, songs, proverbs, practices unique to each MTL. The lessons also reinforce the teaching and learning of foundational social-emotional skills

**(c)	Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**

The objectives of PAL are:

-	To provide Primary 1 and 2 students broad exposure to the four PAL domains of Sports &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Visual Arts and Music which are carried out within curriculum time.

-	Through engaging students in the four domains, students build confidence, curiosity, cooperation, and social and emotional skills.


**(d)	Education and Career Guidance (ECG)**
<br>Through ECG, students will develop a greater sense of self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning. We also want to help our students develop a growth mindset and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate the value of all occupations.

**(e)	National Education (NE)**<br>
NE provides opportunities for our students to explore and examine their identity as Singaporeans and arrive at a common set of ideals and values. We want our students to develop the following key dispositions for citizenship:

1)	Sense of Belonging
2)	Sense of Reality
3)	Sense of Hope
4)	A Will to Act

**Social Studies Curriculum**

NE is also supported by the Social Studies curriculum which aims to help students grow in knowledge, develop skills, and learn values through examining issues that are of concern to our society and the world in which they live in. The Social Studies curriculum also complements the CCE curriculum in nurturing citizenship dispositions.

**(f)	Sexuality Education (SEd)**

SEd is only conducted for Primary 5 and 6 students. The Growing Years Series, a separate syllabus developed by MOE to meet the development needs of our students, is usually conducted during CCE (FTGP) by SEd-trained teachers only.
