<p>In Evergreen Primary School, we believe that every student can be a leader.
We aim to provide leadership opportunities and support students with necessary
knowledge, skills and experiences to value-add their learning experience.</p>
<p><strong>Student Leadership Structure:</strong>
</p>
<p>Our student leaders are grouped into the different tiers and their scope
of leadership influence differs in the various tiers. We strive to provide
many platforms, opportunities and customized training in the various tiers
to develop and hone our students’ leadership potential and prepare them
for their next journey.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Student Leadership Development Cycle:</strong>
</p>
<p>Our leadership curriculum is based on Kouzes and Posner ‘Five Practices
of Exemplary Leadership. This guides the design and placement of leadership
content and experiences at each stage of our development cycle to ensure
our student leaders will become Achievers, Learners and Leaders.</p>
