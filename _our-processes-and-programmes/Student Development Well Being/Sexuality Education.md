<p>MOE SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships with others, including
those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the
family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.</p>

<p>The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b) Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c) Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others</p>
<p>(b) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are
the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c) Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
and</p>
<p>(d) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality
include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Character
and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons</strong>:</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper primary years mark the
onset of puberty. With better nutrition and improved health care, children
are reaching puberty at a younger age and have to grapple with physical,
emotional and psychological changes in themselves. The implication is that
our children are becoming biologically ready for sexual activity sooner
without necessarily having the corresponding cognitive or emotional maturity
to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore, our young are also exposed to
a wide range of influences that could endanger health and undermine the
integrity of the family. Our students require close guidance so that they
can respond with discernment to the sexual messages in the media and other
sources.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons
are taught as part of CCE (FTGP) at Primary 5 and 6. Through these lessons,
students will learn healthy ways to manage the physiological, social and
emotional changes in their growing years. They learn to build healthy and
rewarding relationships with others, including those with members of the
opposite sex. Students are also guided to make wise, informed and responsible
decisions to keep themselves safe from sexuality-related risks.</p>
