<p>At EGPS, student well-being is a cornerstone of our holistic education
approach. The Student Leadership (SLD) Committee, in collaboration with
the Student Development Team (SDT), is committed to nurturing a safe, supportive,
and empowering environment for every student.</p>
<p>Together, we aim to:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Equip students with resilient mindsets and life skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate a strong culture of <strong>Peer Bonding</strong>, <strong>Peer Helping</strong>,

<p><strong>Peer Bonding – (Fostering Bonds and a Sense of Belonging to the school community)</strong>
</p>
<p>We adopt a whole-school approach to build a network of positive peer relationships.
Key initiatives include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Connectogram</strong>: A tool used to map student relationships,
helping us identify students who may need additional social support and
those who can positively influence their peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peer Support Leaders (PSLs)</strong>: Trained student leaders
who actively reach out to peers, build friendships, and promote inclusivity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also promote peer bonding through initiatives such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Birthday Cards</strong> – celebrating each student’s special day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be a Buddy Programme</strong> – pairing students to encourage friendship
and mutual support
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Peer Helping – (Providing Practical help and Social-Emotional Support)</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that every student can play a role in supporting others. To
build a culture of care, we:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Provide opportunities for students to help one another</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Train students to recognize signs of distress in their peers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empower students to stand up for and support others in need</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Peer Influencing – (Influencing mindsets, behaviours &amp; advocating for well-being)</strong>
</p>

with leadership potential are selected as <strong>Peer Support Leaders (PSLs)</strong> and
are given opportunities to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Influence peers through positive actions and communication</p>
</li>
