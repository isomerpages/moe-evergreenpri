<p><strong>Peer Bonding – (Fostering Bonds and a Sense of Belonging to the school community)</strong>
</p>
<p>The SDWB adopts a whole-school approach to shaping a network of positive
relationships in school amongst the student population. We focus on building
an extensive network of student peer supporters to bond with others, help
them and influence them. We also drive, implement and sustain peer support
and relationships efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Peer Helping – (Providing Practical help and Social-Emotional Support)</strong>
</p>
<p>To foster a culture of care amongst the students and to reinforce that
helping peers is for every student, not just for Peer Support Leaders,
the SDWB also gives students opportunities to help each other, provide
training for students to look out for distress signs so that they are more
alert to the needs of others and teach students to stand up for others.</p>

<p><strong>Peer Influencing – (Influencing mindsets, behaviours &amp; advocating for well-being)</strong>
</p>
<p>Every EGPS student is encouraged to be a good role-models to their peers.
Students with leadership qualities are selected as Peer Support Leaders
(PSLs) so they are given opportunities to influence their peers to bond,
help and make a difference. Students are able to actively contribute by
fostering collaboration and support with peers with effective communication.</p>
