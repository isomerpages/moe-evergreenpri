### Pongal Celebration @ Evergreen Primary School

The primary 2 and primary 4 students learning the Tamil Language had a chance to experience Pongal Celebration in school. Pongal is the harvest festival celebrated by Hindus to thank nature. To provide students with an authentic learning experience, parent volunteers together with Tamil Language teachers decorated a part of the school and cooked the “pongal rice”.  Teachers explained the rationale behind pongal celebration and the process.  To promote cultural exchange, students from one of the P2 Chinese class were invited to be part of the celebration. Students not only enjoyed the viewing the process of pongal celebration but also got to taste the ‘pongal’ rice..
