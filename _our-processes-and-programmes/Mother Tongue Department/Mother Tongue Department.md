The primary 2 and primary 4 students learning the Tamil Language had a chance to experience Pongal Celebration in school. Pongal is the harvest festival celebrated by Hindus to thank nature. To provide students with an authentic learning experience, parent volunteers together with Tamil Language teachers decorated a part of the school and cooked the “pongal rice”.  Teachers explained the rationale behind pongal celebration and the process.  To promote cultural exchange, students from one of the P2 Chinese class were invited to be part of the celebration. Students not only enjoyed the viewing the process of pongal celebration but also got to taste the ‘pongal’ rice..

**Hari Raya Aidilfitri (Eid Mubarak)**

In times of COVID-19 pandemic, the Malay Department brought the Hari Raya celebration online. An initiative to celebrate Hari Raya responsibly. Entitled, Circuit Breaker Raya Online 2020 (C.B.R.O. 2020), efforts were made by staff and students of EGPS to adapt to the new norms. Students and staff show resilience during this pandemic period and still are able to celebrate the joyous occasion meaningfully. While the Muslim staff and students navigate through a different kind of celebration this year, it is one that is full of meaning, that strengthen family bonds and stay connected in the comfort of their own homes.
