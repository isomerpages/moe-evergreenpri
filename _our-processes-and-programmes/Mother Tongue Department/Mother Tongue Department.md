The EGPS MT Cultural Camp was organized with the aim of providing a platform for Primary 4 students to learn and appreciate the cultural heritage of their respective mother tongues. The camp focused on promoting cross-culture understanding, exploring the history and fun facts of different cultures, and experiencing the excitement of traditional activities.

This year, the Primary 4 students had the privilege of learning the traditional art for the 3 ethnic races. It kicked off with a Bunga Manggar activity, where students learned about the significance of the decorated palm tree and the role it plays in Malay weddings. The students worked together to create their own Bunga Manggar using colorful crepe paper. This activity gave them a hands-on experience in learning about the Malay culture and traditions. For the Opera Face Mask activity, students learned about the origins and significance of the Chinese Opera Face Masks. They were taught about the different types of masks, colours and their meanings. The students then made their own opera face masks using vibrant colors, giving them a deeper understanding of the Chinese culture. The Agal Villaku painting activity was a fun and interactive experience for the students. They learned about the significance of the Agal Villaku in the Tamil culture and the symbolism behind it. The students then painted their own Agal Villaku using traditional colors, patterns, and designs, making it a memorable learning experience. 

The camp also included a variety of traditional games such as Tarik Upih, Lereng, and Tiger & Goats. These games not only provided entertainment but also taught the students about the history and cultural significance of the games. Overall, the P4 MT Cultural Camp was a fun and exciting experience for the students. They had the opportunity to learn about their own culture as well as others, promoting cross-cultural understanding and appreciation amongst each other. The activities were engaging and interactive, making it a memorable experience for the Primary 4 students.
