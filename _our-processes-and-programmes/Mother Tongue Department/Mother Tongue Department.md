#### Our Mission

To nurture thinking individuals and passionate users of Mother Tongue Languages.

MTL students are developed in 3 critical areas:

*   Deep understanding and appreciation of one’s own Mother Tongue culture and with cross-cultural awareness;
*   Critical thinking skills to question and innovate 

To make MTL a living language we strive to make learning of MT Languages joyful and interesting. Thus, we continuously enhance our teaching strategies to engage our students in learning of the MT Languages. We also provide authentic learning experiences for students to understand and appreciate their culture and have cross-cultural understanding.
