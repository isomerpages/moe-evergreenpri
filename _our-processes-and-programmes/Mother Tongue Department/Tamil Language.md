### Language Fiesta

In Term 3 each year, the Tamil Department conducts various fun-filled activities to encourage the active use of the Tamil Language. Pupils are given the opportunity to learn more about the Tamil language and culture. Activities such as designing Kolam, Show & Tell, Dialogue Creation, Innovation & Enterprise and Character Portrayal were carried out in 2019. The activities gave opportunities for pupils to improve on their spoken Tamil and Language skills. The finalist for each competition will then compete in Tamil Amutham for the top 5 Places.

To nurture students who are passionate and confident users of Tamil Language, the teachers from EGPS Tamil Department organized a competition so that our budding Tamil students can showcase their talents. Students were also able to take initiatives to influence their peers to love the Tamil Language and make it a living language among themselves. 

  

Every Tamil student participated in the preliminary rounds of competition in various formats such as singing, story-telling, role playing of famous personalities and sharing of their personal recollections. The top 30 performers across all six levels were chosen to put up their items in the final round, where prizes were awarded. Parents of our Tamil students also graced this occasion to lend their support for our student performers!

### Pongal Exhibition (2022) 

Pongal is a 4-day harvest festival celebrated by the Tamil diaspora worldwide which falls in the month of Thai (that is, the January-February season) when crops like rice, sugarcane, turmeric are harvested. On this day, Tamil people cook pots of sugary rice to signify their gratitude and celebrate with their loved ones. As the rice overflows when it is cooked, it is believed that the blessings for the year will be overflowing with joy, wealth, and peace.  

At EGPS, our Tamil department held its own “Pongal” celebration by organizing a slew of activities for all students. Through this exhibition, students learned the reason behind the celebration, the value of appreciation and the importance of living in harmony with nature. They learned about the reasons behind the 4 days of celebration as well as the different types of grains, their benefits and uses.
