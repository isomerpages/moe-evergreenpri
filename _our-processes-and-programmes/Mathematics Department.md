# **Mathematics Department**

![](/images/IMG_3086.jpg)

**Vision**   
Every student a confident and independent problem solver.

**Mission**   
To inculcate in students positive attitudes towards mathematics learning and develop in them logical thinking for problem solving.  

**Learning Approach**

In the teaching and learning of mathematics, the school believes in building a strong foundation in mathematics for our students. Students are engaged in the acquisition of mathematical concepts and skills through activity-based lessons using the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach. To develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts, and to make sense of various mathematical ideas as well as their connections and applications, students are exposed to a variety of learning experiences including hands-on activities and use of ICT to help them relate abstract mathematical concepts with concrete experiences. In addition to the learning of mathematical concepts and skills, equally important are the development of mathematical process skills, metacognitive awareness and strategies. These processes are learned through carefully constructed learning experiences which include solving non-routine and open-ended problems where students have the opportunities to explore and discuss their solutions, to think aloud and reflect on their solutions. To support the development of collaborative and communication skills, students will be given opportunities to work on a problem and present their ideas using appropriate mathematical language and methods. Through collaborative learning, students build confidence in problem-solving and foster an interest towards learning mathematics.

### Programmes

#### PROVIDING LEARNING SUPPORT

* **Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)**

Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) is an early intervention effort aimed at providing additional support to P1 and P2 students who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to access the Primary 1 Maths curriculum. Identified students will be supported by a LSM Teacher for 9 periods a week through activity-based lessons focusing on small successes to build on their motivation.

*  **Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)**

The ICAN programme aims to support low progress learners students using intervention strategies to tackle the 4 key issues of learning gaps, language, motivation and memory. The lessons follow the FREMC structure – Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery and Consolidation.

#### CHALLENGING AND DEVELOPING LEANERS TO THEIR POTENTIAL

* **E2K**

Identified P4 and P5 students will be engaged in mathematical thinking through puzzles, games and mathematics explorations, in collaboration with their peers. It aims to develop their mathematical reasoning skills, deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach, and develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess and to develop 21st century competencies, such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.  
  

* **Mathematics Olympiad Training**

Identified P4, P5 and P6 students will be equipped with the necessary Mathematical knowledge and repertoire of problem-solving and critical thinking skills to tackle higher-order and non-routine problems. Some of the competitions these students will take part include:

* Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad (SASMO)
* Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (SMOPS)

#### GENERATING INTEREST IN MATH LEARNING

* **Mathematics Trails**

P1 to P3 students engage in meaningful learning experiences to interact with mathematics around them. Through complementing the content of Mathematics taught in the classroom, students apply mathematical skills to solve real-life problems, developing an appreciation and enjoyment of Mathematics in everyday situations.  
  

* **Mathematics Month**

P1 to P6 students explore Math concepts, logic and reasoning skills through hands-on activities in structured play settings. This also aims to develop and strengthen their social skills through interaction with their friends during play. This provides opportunities for students to exercise SEL competencies and to explore making choices of their own unstructured play
