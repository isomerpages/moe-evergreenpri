**Lunar New Year Celebration**

Excitement filled the air at EGPS as the school joyously ushered in the Lunar New Year of 2024! The Dragon, a symbol of strength, wisdom, and good fortune, took center stage as our beacon of prosperity for the coming year.

Decked in vibrant reds and Chinese traditional costumes, the EGPS community gathered in the Multi-Purpose Hall (MPH) for an unforgettable celebration. Anticipation danced in our eyes as we eagerly awaited the mesmerizing performances that awaited us.

The atmosphere crackled with energy as the traditional lion and dragon dance troupe took the stage, weaving through the crowd, symbolizing the warding off of evil spirits and the beckoning of good luck. The staff and students were enthralled by the rhythmic drumbeats and graceful movements, setting the stage for an auspicious year ahead.

The celebration continued to crescendo with a burst of talent from our very own EGPS students. The MPH transformed into a stage for a kaleidoscope of performances - from dramatic displays to soul-stirring singing and instrumental prowess. Our students, like shining stars, showcased their diverse talents, leaving the audience in awe.

The grand finale was nothing short of spectacular as the entire school, led by the Chinese Language Unit, united in a jubilant sing-and-dance performance. Laughter and joy echoed through the halls as we collectively embraced the spirit of the Lunar New Year, bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new with open arms.

**Hosting of North Zone Chinese Speech Competition 2024

This year, Evergreen Primary School and Evergreen Secondary School  jointly hosted the North Zone Schools Chinese Speech Competition for the fourth consecutive year. The event witnessed an overwhelming response, with over 190 primary and secondary school students enthusiastically signing up to participate.

Eight participants from both the primary and secondary categories advanced to the final round after going through a rigorous selection process. The culmination of the competition occurred this afternoon at Evergreen Secondary School. They displayed their talents and eloquence and students from Canberra Primary School and Evergreen Secondary School were awarded with the top prize. 

**Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) **

This year, our Chinese Unit participated in the Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES), an initiative by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL). Through this programme, our Primary 3 students enjoyed the cultural performance "The wee Question Mark and the Adventurer" by The Theatre Practice Ltd. The experience was both entertaining and educational, providing our students with a deeper appreciation of Chinese Language and its culture. 

**E-Immersion Programme **

On 17 May 2024, the Chinese Unit organized an enriching e-immersion programme for Primary 5 students taking Chinese Language. The event aimed to deepen students' cultural understanding and foster international friendships.

The programme began with an on-site tour guide who shared captivating insights about Yue Fei Temple in Hangzhou. Students were inspired by the patriotic spirit of Yue Fei, gaining a deeper appreciation for this historic site.

Following the tour, students engaged in a virtual interaction session with their peers from Ren Min Primary School in Hangzhou, China. During this session, students introduced themselves, shared details about local tourist attractions, and discussed their favourite delicacies. This exchange provided a unique platform for students from both schools to build friendships and celebrate the cultural diversity between their countries.

The session concluded with a memorable group photo, marking the beginning of a promising friendship between the students of Evergreen Primary School and Ren Min Primary School. This successful event highlighted the importance of cultural exchange and the benefits of embracing global connections.
