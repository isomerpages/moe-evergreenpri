### Our Vision:

Every student a confident and competent user of the English Language.

### Our Beliefs:

We believe in building a strong foundation in students’ language skills and providing rich language for all. We believe that language is acquired through reading and frequent use.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research on language learner reading shows how extensive reading feeds into improvements in all areas of language competence (Krashen 2004). As such, we have an array of programmes to promote reading. Opportunities are provided for students to read good books, listen to stories and voice their opinions.

Language is also a tool for communication. The importance of speaking skills, hence is enormous for the learners of any language. It is important to speak correctly and effectively in-order to communicate well with one another. We have provided various platforms to allow our students to use language confidently through public performances, language games and activities.

We hope to develop our students so that they can be confident and competent users of the English Language. 


### Approach:

The English Language Department has adopted a two-pronged of building a strong foundation and providing rich language, focusing on reading and speaking.   Our reading and spoken English programmes are planned to enable our students to build their repertoire of vocabulary and grammar skills and use them in writing and oral presentations.  

### Key Events and Activities


**Library and Reading Programmes: Assembly Talk**

At the beginning of the year, as part of our school library programme, an assembly talk was conducted by our teacher, Mdm Andrea and National Library Board Associate Librarian, Miss Shi Cheng.  The purpose of the assembly is to promote reading among students and to foster in them a greater appreciation for books. Our students were informed of the EGPS library activities planned for them.  They were also introduced to books of different genres. Miss Shi highlighted the initiatives and activities that our students could participate organised by NLB.

### Writing Programme - Budding Writers

The writing programme aims to recognise and encourage budding writers in the school and boost their creativity and confidence in writing. Students were exposed to different writing genres and text types and provided with a platform to engage in constructive discourse with their peers during the writing process.  It also reinforced the language items taught in school and showed the connection of the different aspects of language.

Budding writers from P5 and P6 were selected to be part of the programme at the start of the year. They are
