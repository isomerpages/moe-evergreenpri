<h2><strong>Mathematics at Evergreen Primary</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Building Confident Problem Solvers with Purpose and Progression</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Evergreen Primary, Mathematics is taught with clarity, structure, and
intent. Our curriculum aligns fully with the Ministry of Education’s 2021
syllabus and is designed to nurture confident problem solvers who think
logically, reason mathematically, and apply their learning to meaningful
contexts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From Primary 1 to Primary 6, students build strong numeracy foundations,
fluency in operations, and conceptual understanding through a range of
teaching strategies—including activity-based learning, inquiry, direct
instruction, and the purposeful use of ICT.

<br><strong>How We Teach Mathematics at Evergreen</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mathematics lessons are structured to be purposeful, progressive, and
engaging. Core strands, including Numbers and Algebra, Measurement, Geometry,
and Statistics, are covered across all levels, with appropriate scaffolding
to support both Standard and Foundation learners.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students engage in:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Concrete–pictorial–abstract (CPA) learning to strengthen understanding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activity and inquiry-based tasks to promote curiosity and exploration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct instruction to build fluency and procedural confidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of ICT tools to visualise and consolidate learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differentiated support to meet diverse learning needs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>At each stage, learning is intentionally paced and sequenced, preparing
students for PSLE readiness and real-life application.</p>

<p><strong>Key Mathematics Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br><strong>T.G.I.F: That’s Great, It’s Friday</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br>Jointly run with the Science department, TGIF engages students in hands-on
games and puzzles that integrate mathematical and scientific thinking.
Students enjoy working through challenges that stretch logic, creativity,
and communication—in an environment that celebrates discovery and fun.</p>

<br><strong>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Designed for Primary 1 to Primary 4 students who require more time to
consolidate foundational skills, LSM provides small-group instruction led
by specially trained teachers. Using STP and ICAN-informed strategies,
students receive personalised guidance in a setting that encourages perseverance
and growth.</p>

<p><strong>Tiered Stretch Programmes to Support and Extend</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We believe every learner deserves the right level of support and challenge.
Our three-tiered stretch model nurtures students at different readiness
levels:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Tier 1:</strong> All students build heuristic problem-solving skills
using the STAR approach (Study, Think, Act, Reflect), boosting confidence
and process awareness.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Tier 2: </strong>Selected P3 to P5 students join the E2K Programme,
exploring open-ended problems through inquiry and collaborative dialogue.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Tier 3: </strong>High-progress learners from P4 to P6 undergo
Math Olympiad training and engage in competitions to deepen reasoning and
exposure to complex problem types.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Celebrating Growth and Achievement</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Participation in national competitions encourages students to stretch
their thinking and take pride in their learning.</p>
