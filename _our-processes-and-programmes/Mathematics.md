**Vision**   
Every student a confident and independent problem solver.

**Mission**   
To inculcate in students, positive attitudes towards Mathematics learning and develop in them logical thinking for problem solving.  
 

**Learning Approach**

In the teaching and learning of Mathematics, the school believes in building a strong foundation in mathematics for our students. 
Students are engaged in the acquisition of Mathematical concepts and skills through activity-based lessons using the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach. To develop a deep understanding of Mathematical concepts, and to make sense of various Mathematical ideas as well as their connections and applications, students are exposed to a variety of learning experiences including hands-on activities and use of ICT to help them relate abstract Mathematical concepts with concrete experiences.
In addition to the learning of Mathematical concepts and skills, equally important are the development of Mathematical process skills, metacognitive awareness, and strategies. These processes are learned through carefully constructed learning experiences which include solving non-routine and open-ended problems where students have the opportunities to explore and discuss their solutions, to think aloud and reflect on their solutions. 
To support the development of collaborative and communication skills, students will be given opportunities to work on a problem and present their ideas using appropriate Mathematical language and methods. Through collaborative learning, students build confidence in problem-solving and foster an interest towards learning Mathematics.



#### PROVIDING LEARNING SUPPORT

* **Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)**

Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) provides additional support to students who need help in acquiring basic numeracy skills. Identified students are taught in smaller groups during Math periods by specially trained teachers, where they learn through varied activities.

LSM support is provided for up to 4 years, but students’ progress is reviewed annually. The LSM Programme focuses on building good Mathematical understanding and aims to build students’ confidence and positive beliefs about their ability to do Math. Students receive more individual attention from teacher and receive help in specific areas that they are weak in. 


*  **Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)**

The ICAN programme aims to support low progress learners who generally do not have a good understanding and mastery of fundamental Mathematics concepts and skills. To help students learn and handle more difficult Math concept and skills, teachers focus on building both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency in the instruction. 

Instruction is organised using the FREMC structure – Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery and Consolidation – to keep in focus the important elements in each lesson. Through the varied intervention strategies, we hoped to tackle the 4 key issues of learning in our students - leaning gaps, language, motivation, and memory.

#### CHALLENGING AND DEVELOPING LEANERS TO THEIR POTENTIAL

The central focus of the Mathematics curriculum is to develop Mathematical problem-solving competency in our students. Students will have opportunities to solve varied Mathematical problems which are straight forward and routine as well as complex and non-routine. 

In EGPS, we provide differentiated approaches to teach our students to select and apply the appropriate concepts and skills and use logical reasoning and creative thinking to tackle tasks systematically and effectively. These approaches will also provide them the  opportunities to develop key competencies that are important in the 21st century.

*   Tier 1 : Learning of Heuristic Skills
    

Students will be exposed to different types of heuristics skills throughout the six years. They will be explicitly taught on to approach the different problems using Pólya’s 4 steps to Problem-Solving or the STAR approach – Study the Problem, Think of a Plan, Act and Execute, and Reflect and Check.

*   Tier 2 : E2K lessons
    
Identified P3 to P5 students will be engaged in mathematical thinking through puzzles, games, and mathematics explorations, in collaboration with their peers. It aims to develop their mathematical reasoning skills, deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach, and develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions Mathematicians possess and to develop 21st century competencies, such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.

*   Tier 3 : External Competitions and Olympiad Trainings
    

Identified P4, P5 and P6 students will be exposed to a diverse range of activities that goes beyond the regular math curriculum and extend their capabilities. They explore challenging math problems, participate in group discussions, and receive specialised coaching. These sessions are specifically designed to foster the development of higher-order thinking skills, logical reasoning abilities, and problem-solving techniques among students. 

Students will then get the opportunities to participate in various external and prestigious competitions.

Some of the competitions these students will take part include:

●        Hwa Chong Institution Singapore Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (SMOPS)

●        NUS High School National Math Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS)

●        Singapore and Asian Schools Competition (SASMO)

●        Singapore Math Kangaroo Contest (SMKC)

●        River Valley Math Challenge (RVMC)

      

**Generating Interest in Math Learning**

●        **T.G.I.F (Collaboration with Science Department)**

One of EGPS’ signature programmes is T.G.I.F – That’s Great, It’s Friday! – where students come together to learn through P.L.A.Y.


In Term 1, the Math and Science departments collaborated to curate activities which aimed to seamlessly blend Math and Science concepts in a fun and engaging way. Students explored Math concepts, logic, and reasoning skills through hands-on activities in structured play settings. 

This also aims to develop and strengthen their social skills through interaction with their friends during play. This provides opportunities for students to exercise SEL competencies and to explore making choices of their own unstructured play.
