To inculcate desired shared values and equip our students with the social and emotional competencies to be future-ready global citizens.

In CCE, our students learn to be responsible to family and community; understand their roles in shaping the future of our nation. The goal of CCE is to inculcate values and build competencies in our students to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens.

 
### CCE Curriculum

The CCE Curriculum comprises CCE lessons, Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and school-based CCE and CCE Guidance Module.

The CCE Syllabus provides the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to be taught explicitly through the CCE Curriculum. Sexuality Education (SEd) for Primary 5 and 6 students is taught through Curious Minds 2, a separate syllabus developed by MOE to meet the development needs of our students.
