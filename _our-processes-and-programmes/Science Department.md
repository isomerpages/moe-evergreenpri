# **Science Department**

![](/images/IMG_3096.jpg)

The Science Department is committed to helping every student develop as an inquirer who has the lifelong interest in learning Science through a standards-based curriculum that includes inquiry, investigation, experimentation and reflective thinking.

 It is important to our department that students develop an understanding of how science impacts their daily lives. 

### Pedagogy

The Science curriculum at EGPS adopts the pedagogy of inquiry-based learning (IBL) and reflective thinking. The premise is that students should participate actively in learning and to constantly reflect on their learning. Through active learning, students learn better, as their questions and reflections help them comprehend and synthesize knowledge.  

Inquiry-based Learning (IBL)  

The (IBL) is a student-centered learning process based on John Dewey’s learning theory of constructivism where hands-on activities are used to develop concepts through creative problem solving, decision-making and investigation processes.   

In our day-to-day teaching of inquiry-based Science, our teachers focus on asking questions as well as encouraging students to ask relevant questions. Questioning strategy allows for a high degree of pupil participation as a good mix of low and high level cognitive questions are used. The use of Object-Based Inquiry (OBI) and the modified thinking routine of See-Think-Wonder,  tapped on students’ natural curiosity that promote the cycle of inquiry which allows students to construct meaning from their interactions with objects and phenomena in and out of the classroom through observation, developing inferences and generating their own questions.   

To provide an appealing and non-threatening way to represent abstract concepts and ideas. concept cartoons which are “cartoon-style” drawings presenting characters with different viewpoints around a particular situation are used at different stages of a lesson – as a trigger to get students to tune in, as an activity to elicit students’ responses and generate discussion, as a means to clear misconceptions or as a means of summarizing the topic at the end. Science lessons thus becomes more interactive and student-centred as students are actively involved in their learning: verbalize their ideas and thoughts. Participating in such discussion also lets students hone their communication skills and in the process allows teachers to gain important insights into their students’ understanding.   

  

#### Reflective Thinking Routine

Reflective thinking helps learners develop higher-order thinking skills by prompting learners to relate new knowledge to prior understanding, think in both abstract and conceptual terms, apply specific strategies in novel tasks, and understand their own thinking and learning strategies. The use of thinking routine ‘I used to think...but now I think” strategy helps students to reflect on their thinking about a topic or issue and explore how and why that thinking has changed. It is useful in consolidating new learning as students identify their new understandings, opinions, and beliefs. By examining and explaining how and why their thinking has changed, students are developing their reasoning abilities and recognizing cause and effect relationships.  

 
#### Mapping Across Curriculum (MAC)

MAC allows teachers to use personal, local or global events to stimulate students’ exploration and questions. Students are provided with the opportunities to apply concepts in varied contexts through authentic learning, use of ICT, self-directed as well as collaborative learning experiences that promote students’ scientific literacy and make science learning more meaningful. It is also aim to inculcate the skills, ethics and attitudes of the 21st Century Competencies, such as Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-cultural Skills, Critical and Inventive Thinking, and Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills in order to realize our vision of seeing our students growing up to become confident people, self-directed learners, concerned citizens, and active contributors to the nation.  

  

### JUNIOR SCIENCE PROGRAMME

This programme is mainly integrated into the teaching of English in Primary 1 and Primary 2. However, there are selected stand-alone hands-on activities conducted by our Science teachers for Primary 1 and Primary 2 students once per semester. The Junior Science programme also taps on the natural curiosity of the Primary 1 and 2 students, to further develop their interest science.   

  

### ELEMENTZ SCIENCE PROJECT COMPETITION  

Students who have shown high level of inquisitiveness and innovation during the Engineering Design Programme, will be invited to take part in this annual competition organised by Anderson Junior College at the cluster level. The competition provides a platform for students to showcase their research projects and presentation skills.

### iWonder  

Ever since the opening of iWonder this year, the room has attracted many students on Fridays during TGIF. Different activities such as LEGO blocks, straws and coding would be introduced each month. The freedom and space to explore have unleashed our students’ creativity and innovativeness as they go about tinkering with the materials. Some of the students even requested for their partially completed product to be kept aside safely in the room for them to continue the following week. Amidst all these activities, the students are exposed to problem-solving and how small steady steps could eventually lead them to reach their goal!  

  
Below are snippets of what took place in iWonder.

### Innovation @EGPS

Aligned to our school’s mission of P.L.A.Y._,_ our Science Department conducts several activities and enrichment programmes throughout the year as part of our Innovation Programme. In addition to encourage integration of the different subjects so as to provide a holistic and joyful learning experience for our students, we also hope to inculcate values and skills in them so as to develop them to be good and useful individuals.

* **E2K Science Programme**

The E2K Science Programme is an enrichment programme conducted after school for students who demonstrate interest and aptitude for Science. The programme aims to develop scientific inquiry process skills in our students to stretch them in Science and to generate their interest in Science research.

The rich learning experiences serve to help our students develop positive habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess. Just as scientists explore and make mistakes in the real world, our students are allowed to make mistakes during the programme and learn from the mistakes based on scaffold given by teacher mentors. As our students engage in scientific investigations through an inquiry approach, we hope to nurture them in the 21st century competencies such as resilience, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.

*  **Design Thinking Programme**

To build a culture of empathy, innovation, creativity and discovery in our students, they participated in our Design Thinking Programme. For this year, the programme provides our students with opportunities to apply Science concepts into creating novel toys. Prior to that, students would be guided to make connections to the application of Science concepts in common toys that they have played before.

This programme has motivated our students to think out of the box – beyond what they are learning within the curriculum. The whole learning experience served as a stepping stone for our students to embark on external Science competitions.

*  **S.T.E.A.M. Activities**

 Besides the above enrichment programmes, our Science department also engages our students in S.T.E.A.M. activities during Science lessons to strengthen and support their learning in Science. Through these activities, opportunities for P.L.A.Y are provided as our students explore their potential as innovative inquirers.

 One such activity involves students creating models to demonstrate their learning such as the cell model, the lung model and the heart model. The hands-on activity has helped our students gain a better understanding of the content taught as they try to make connections of their observations on the models to the concepts learnt. At the same time, in the process of making the models, our students are encouraged to be creative and innovative in using the appropriate materials and designs.

 Various types of cell models created by our students were exhibited as part of an educational display for students from the other levels. This is also to recognise their efforts in making these models.
 
 **Environmental Education 2021**
