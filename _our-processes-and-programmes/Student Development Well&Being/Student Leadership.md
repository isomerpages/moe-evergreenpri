# **Student Leadership**

### EGPS STUDENT LEADERSHIP

In Evergreen Primary, we believe that every child is a leader. The Student Leadership Committee work with the teachers to create a positive learning environment to develop our students holistically.&nbsp;

The school has put in place a structured leadership development programme to develop the leadership qualities of the students through the different tiers of leadership. They are given opportunities to develop 21st Core Competencies (21CC) and Social-Emotional competencies.&nbsp;

In Evergreen Primary, we believe that every child has the potential to be developed as a leader. Every student possess his/her unique blend of abilities, inclinations and talents. Every student can make positive difference in his/her own right within his/her sphere of influence, and thereby a leader. By helping them to discover their strengths to take charge of their lives, students discover their unique value as leaders.
  

**Vision**

Every student is a leader and a peer supporter.

**Mission**

To develop leaders who are values-driven and willing to serve others.
