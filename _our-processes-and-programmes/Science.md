<p><strong>“Exploring Science, Empowering Minds, Enriching Lives.”</strong>
</p>
<p>At Evergreen Primary School, the Science Department is dedicated to nurturing
our students to be Achievers, Learners, and Leaders who are equipped to
thrive in a rapidly changing world. In line with our school’s Vision, Mission,
and Values, we seek to nurture hearts, cultivate minds, and enrich lives
through the strength of the community. Our programmes are designed not
only to deepen scientific knowledge, but also to spark curiosity, creativity,
and care for the environment and society.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiring Inquiry and Discovery</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that every child is a scientist at heart. Through inquiry-based
learning, we encourage our students to ask questions, investigate ideas,
and make meaningful connections between scientific concepts and real-world
applications. Our lessons emphasise active learning, collaborative problem-solving,
and reflection, ensuring that students are both engaged and empowered in
their learning journey. Through their learning experiences, students develop
Emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC) such as critical and inventive
thinking, collaboration, communication, and responsible decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Signature Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – Sustainability and STEM</strong>
<br>Our ALP gives students authentic opportunities to explore sustainability
through science and technology.</p>

<p>Our Science Leaders also lead the Food For Thought Initiative, where they
first attend a workshop on food waste and conduct investigations to estimate
the amount of food discarded by students during recess. Following this,
they raise awareness across the school by sharing their findings and key
messages on the food journey, types of food waste, and the importance of
reducing waste. These are showcased through the canteen television and
posters created by the leaders.</p>

<p>World Water Day was commemorated to deepen students’ appreciation of water
as a precious resource. Through the engaging assembly talk, students learnt
about global and local water challenges as well as practical ways to conserve
water at home and in school. To extend the learning, recess-time quizzes
and interactive games were organised, allowing students to apply their
knowledge in fun and meaningful ways. These activities reinforced the importance
of water conservation and nurtured a sense of responsibility towards safeguarding
our precious resource..</p>
<p>In all, our Eco Stewardship Programme aims to raise awareness and promote
sustainable living, empowering students to play their part for the environment
by building a culture of responsibility, empathy, and active citizenship.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>STEM Challenges Across Levels</strong>
<br>Our Science Department designs hands-on challenges that inspire students
to create, innovate, and collaborate. At each level, students tackle real-world
problems in exciting ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>P3:</strong> Boat Design Challenge – experimenting with buoyancy
and stability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P4:</strong> Self-Watering Plant System – applying knowledge of
plant transport systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P5:</strong> Rainwater Harvester – exploring water conservation
and sustainability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P6:</strong> Solar Oven – harnessing renewable energy through design
and testing.
<br>Beyond the curriculum, our <em>TGIF Strongest Bridge Challenge</em> provides
an open platform for students to showcase creativity, resilience, problem-solving,
and collaboration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Competitions and External Platforms</strong>
<br>Our students take pride in representing the school at a wide range of
external science competitions. These include the Elementz Science Project
Competition, the Raffles Science Olympiad, and the NUS High Science Olympiad.
Through these platforms, students gain valuable exposure to higher-level
scientific inquiry, strengthen their confidence, communication, and critical
thinking skills, and are motivated to pursue their interests with passion
and perseverance.</p>
<p><strong>Growing Achievers, Learners, and Leaders</strong>
</p>
<p>Through these diverse programmes, the Science Department strives to develop
students who are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Achievers</strong> who set high standards, work hard, and take
pride in their learning outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learners</strong> who are curious, reflective, and empowered to
take ownership of their growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leaders</strong> who inspire others, demonstrate responsibility,
and contribute positively to their community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, our goal is to nurture future-ready individuals who embody
resilience, responsibility, creativity, and the full spectrum of E21CC
skills, ensuring they will continue to explore, innovate, and care for
the world around them.</p>
