**Purpose**

In Evergreen Primary School, the Holistic Health Framework (HHF) guides us to bring together purposeful manner the key areas, programmes and processes that develop the physical, mental and social health of our students.

**Process**

The HHF focuses on the total well-being which goes beyond weight and fitness to encompass the holistic development and domains of students’ well-being. We hope to develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes of every student to live healthily through quality delivery by trained teachers and qualified learning partners.

**People**

Our school PE department continues to work closely with our learning partners like HPB, NKF and ActiveSG to carry out programmes and bring in specialists to deliver quality and sustainable programmes.

Coaching by Teachers - Programme for students who need more support

This programme allows PE teachers to coach, encourage and motivate students to adopt and sustain their healthy lifestyle habits via a regular platform for students to meet the teachers to share their progress and lifestyle habits.

We strongly encourage parents to play an active role in the journey by sharing health and fitness related information and talks to help the students cultivate good lifestyle and eating habits.

**Programmes**

The annual Health Screening Programme by the School Health Services (SHS) under the HPB also allows us to gather valuable information on students’ health status. We are then able to use the relevant health information to ensure the safety and well-being of our students in school are in check.

In addition, at risk students will go for further assessment at the Student Health Centre (SHC) at HPB. Their progress will be closely monitored to help them attain a better health and physical fitness status.

Our yearly activities for students include:

### PE TGIF

For TGIF PE, P1 to P6 students went through a variety of challenges and workouts, giving them the opportunities to work and have fun as a class. The P6 students took part in three different challenges with the theme “Every Second Counts”. The challenges require the students to complete the task as a class as fast as possible, and it requires them to apply the skills learnt during PE lessons.
 

For the P1 to P5 students, they took part in a weekly e-TGIF to do our PE department signature workout video Start With Exercise Actively Together (SWEAT) series. Through these activities, students were able to strengthen the camaraderie bonds with their peers by working and exercising together.

In addition to the TGIF, a step challenge (Every Step Matters) was conducted as a school-wide event for the entire year. This challenge allows students to foster and develop stronger relationships between peers and families, and to start a healthy lifestyle to improve both body and mental health.

### X Games

Our annual Experiential Games called the X Games was held on 1 April 2021. It was organised for the Primary 3 to 6 students which was held at Evergreen Primary School. During the event, students were required to complete a total of 2 challenges as a class with the theme “Every Second Counts”. Top 3 classes for each level were given a X-Games collar pin and a certificate for completing the challenges in the fastest time possible.

Through these challenges, students were given opportunities to not only participate actively in all the challenges, but also work collaboratively as a class to complete them. Students had to learn to negotiate and communicate their ideas actively and solve the problems together as a class.

With the focus on the school values of Respect, Grit and Integrity, the students were able to strengthen their bond and camaraderie at the end of the challenge.

### UPLAY & UREAD

Unstructured play (UPLAY) and unstructured read (UREAD) recess programme is a new initiative by the department to give students the opportunity to be actively and meaningfully engaged during their recess. This programme allows students a choice to occupy their free time besides eating to be g engaged through unstructured play or reading during their recess time.

For UPLAY, PE equipment such as badminton racquets, basketball and more are provided and set up for them daily at the parade square for the students to play freely with their peers.

For UREAD, students get to go to the school library called Storyhouse that houses a wide variety of books for students to read their favourite books.

Through this programme, students are given not only the opportunities but also choices on how they want to be actively engaged during recess according to their interest. This approach purports to achieve joy in learning for the students.
