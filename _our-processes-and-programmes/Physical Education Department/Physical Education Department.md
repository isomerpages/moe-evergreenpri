![](/images/PE(1).jpg)

**Purpose**

In Evergreen Primary School, the Holistic Health Framework (HHF) guides us to bring together purposeful manner the key areas, programmes and processes that develop the physical, mental and social health of our students.

**Process**

The HHF focuses on the total well-being which goes beyond weight and fitness to encompass the holistic development and domains of students’ well-being. We hope to develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes of every student to live healthily through quality delivery by trained teachers and qualified learning partners.

**People**

Our school PE department continues to work closely with our learning partners like HPB, NKF and ActiveSG to carry out programmes and bring in specialists to deliver quality and sustainable programmes.

Coaching by Teachers - Programme for students who need more support

This programme allows PE teachers to coach, encourage and motivate students to adopt and sustain their healthy lifestyle habits via a regular platform for students to meet the teachers to share their progress and lifestyle habits.

We strongly encourage parents to play an active role in the journey by sharing health and fitness related information and talks to help the students cultivate good lifestyle and eating habits.

**Programmes**

The annual Health Screening Programme by the School Health Services (SHS) under the HPB also allows us to gather valuable information on students’ health status. We are then able to use the relevant health information to ensure the safety and well-being of our students in school are in check.

In addition, at risk students will go for further assessment at the Student Health Centre (SHC) at HPB. Their progress will be closely monitored to help them attain a better health and physical fitness status.

Our yearly activities for students include:

### PE TGIF

For TGIF PE, P1 to P6 students went through a variety of challenges and workouts, giving them the opportunities to work and have fun as a class. The P6 students took part in three different challenges with the theme “Every Second Counts”. The challenges require the students to complete the task as a class as fast as possible, and it requires them to apply the skills learnt during PE lessons.
 

For the P1 to P5 students, they took part in a weekly e-TGIF to do our PE department signature workout video Start With Exercise Actively Together (SWEAT) series. Through these activities, students were able to strengthen the camaraderie bonds with their peers by working and exercising together.

In addition to the TGIF, a step challenge (Every Step Matters) was conducted as a school-wide event for the entire year. This challenge allows students to foster and develop stronger relationships between peers and families, and to start a healthy lifestyle to improve both body and mental health.

#### X-Games 

The EGPS X-Games was conducted this year with the aim of providing sports exposure to Primary 4 to 6 students, allowing them to explore different sports and engage in physical activities. By participating in one of the six sports offered, namely Tchoukball, Kinball, Archery Tag, Ultimate Frisbee, Tag Rugby, and Goalball, the students had the opportunity to experience a variety of athletic disciplines. A follow-up to the X-Games was the extension to English lessons, where P4 to P6 students wrote a note of appreciation to affirm and acknowledge their peers or teachers who had helped them in one way or another.  

 
This encourages them to recognize and express gratitude towards individuals. They were also required to write a journal entry to affirm themselves of the hard work that they had put in in overcoming the challenges they had faced. The students are encouraged to acknowledge their efforts, grit, and growth in the face of adversity. The X-Games serve as a platform for students to engage in sports, explore their interests, and cultivate positive values through active participation, which of course, embodies the EGPS P.L.A.Y. approach.

### UPLAY &amp; UREAD

Unstructured play (UPLAY) and unstructured read (UREAD) recess programme is a new initiative by the department to give students the opportunity to be actively and meaningfully engaged during their recess. This programme allows students a choice to occupy their free time besides eating to be g engaged through unstructured play or reading during their recess time.

For UPLAY, PE equipment such as badminton racquets, basketball and more are provided and set up for them daily at the parade square for the students to play freely with their peers.

For UREAD, students get to go to the school library called Storyhouse that houses a wide variety of books for students to read their favourite books.

Through this programme, students are given not only the opportunities but also choices on how they want to be actively engaged during recess according to their interest. This approach purports to achieve joy in learning for the students.

### P6 PEX

At the end of the Primary 6 journey, a 2-Day Post-Exam Experience in-school camp was organised as a post-exam activity for the Primary 6 students who had successfully completed their PSLE. Students were given the opportunity to experience Outdoor Education Experience (OEX) and Intra-Class Games Experience (ICGX) during these two days.

Students were not only able to forge stronger camaraderie with their peers and teachers, but they were also given the chance to be exposed to survival skills such as first aid and knot tying during OEX, and also to demonstrate the school values such as Grit and Empathy when they participated in the modified Paralympic games such as Boccia during ICGX.

### P5 Outdoor Adventure Learning Camp 

Outdoor Camping is one of the ways that can used to build Grit, as students can learn problem-solving and leadership skills. Using the outdoors as the ‘classroom’ for learning, students are provided with the opportunity to work together with their peers. Students also embrace diversity and forge camaraderie and social bonds that can last a lifetime. Teachers joining the students during the camp also help to strengthen the Teacher-Student relationship through out of classroom interactions. 

 

The P5 Camp was held this year at Pasir Ris Heritage Chalet, to build on the above mentioned objectives. Students underwent a variety of outdoor learning activities as they worked together in their groups. It was a fun-filled and meaningful 3 day 2 night camp which culminated in a campfire highlighting individual class performances. 

At EGPS, we strive to provide a mix of learning experiences for each student, with purpose and passion.
