### New Media Literacies

New Media Literacies are defined as the competencies to create, connect and curate information in the digital networked environment. Acquiring competency in these will enable students to develop an understanding of the social practices governing the Web and be equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate and participate productively.

At Evergreen Primary, we will engage students in acquiring New Media Literacies through Digital Literacy lessons and Cyberwellness lessons.

### Digital Literacy Lessons

Digital Literacy lessons are carried out as part of the Multi-Modal Programme (MMP) for Primary 1 to Primary 6 levels. The following shows a map of the outcomes taught at the various levels.
