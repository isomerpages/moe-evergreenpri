![](/images/Department%20Main%20Photos/img_3331.JPG)

The ICT department aims to create a technology-enriched learning environment that promotes the effective use of technology for quality teaching and learning, and a strong ICT curriculum to help our students develop the 21st Century Competencies.

### Vision:

Every teacher a designer and facilitator of tech-mediated learning experiences.
Every student an active learner and a responsible digital user.

### Mission:

To build teachers’ capacity to design, enact and assess with technology for active learning in class and beyond the classroom.
To develop student’ ability to connect, create and curate information in a digital environment anchored on sound values.

### e-Pedagogy @ EGPS
Our teachers are equipped with the knowledge and skills to design e-pedagogy lessons, leveraging on the affordances of ICT to enhance teaching and learning. The lessons are guided by the five key actions for lesson design, enactment and review.

### ICT CURRICULUM

At Evergreen Primary, we engage students in acquiring New Media Literacies through Digital Literacy lessons and Cyberwellness lessons to equip them with the knowledge and skills to navigate and participate productively and to enable them to develop an understanding of the social practices governing the internet.
These lessons include elements of New Media Literacy – namely, the ability to Create, Connect and Curate information in the digital networked environment. As seen in the framework by MOE, the six core values of the 21st CC are in the heart of these interactions which anchor the learning experiences to develop a discerning and responsible user of technology.

### Digital Literacy Lessons

Digital Literacy lessons are carried out as part of the Multi-Modal Programme (MMP) for Primary 1 to Primary 6 levels. 
At the lower primary level, students learn how to operate computing devices and use applications and software for learning. 
At the middle and upper primary, students learn how to gather information, use digital resources in a safe and responsible manner, use software and devices to facilitate the use of knowledge and skills in different ways, produce digital products and collaborate online.

### Cyberwellness Curriculum

Our cyberwellness curriculum aims to equip our students with skills to navigate the online space confidently and use technology healthily.
The approach to Cyberwellness curriculum is guided by MOE’s Cyberwellness principles of:

1.      Respect for Self and Others
2.      Safe and Responsible Use
3.      Positive Peer Influence

Cyberwellness lessons are taught through authentic scenarios such as interactive video discussions during the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and sharing by Cyberwellness ambassadors during assembly.

### ICT ENRICHMENT PROGRAMMES 

**Code for Fun for Primary 4**

This programme is compulsory for all Primary 4 students to equip them with baseline computational thinking skills before they leave primary school. The programme also introduces students to some basic concepts of emerging technology. Through this 10-hour curriculum, students will be able to:

* Learn about core computational thinking concepts and how it can be applied to aspects of daily life;

* Understand basic programming concepts such as debugging, events, loops, variables and functions;

* Develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills; and

* Be introduced to emerging technologies such as A.I. and cybersecurity

**Digital Animation for P5**

As part of the MMP, our P5 students learn how to create digital animation using iPads. The lessons span over a term where students learn about the principles of storyboarding and the use of animation app to create their works. To make learning authentic, they are tasked to create animations to help spread the messages tied to our school campaign and/or programmes (such as the ‘zero-bullying’ campaign).


### Student Learning Space

### New Media Literacies

New Media Literacies are defined as the competencies to create, connect and curate information in the digital networked environment. Acquiring competency in these will enable students to develop an understanding of the social practices governing the Web and be equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate and participate productively.

At Evergreen Primary, we will engage students in acquiring New Media Literacies through Digital Literacy lessons and Cyberwellness lessons.

### Digital Literacy Lessons

Digital Literacy lessons are carried out as part of the Multi-Modal Programme (MMP) for Primary 1 to Primary 6 levels. The following shows a map of the outcomes taught at the various levels.
