### Aesthetics Department Vision and Mission

**Vision**

Every Student is An Artiste

**Mission**

To nurture, develop and inspire students to instill a strong sense of appreciation for the Arts and self manage their emotions and thoughts through the Arts.

**Aesthetics Department Framework and LLP**

Evergreen Primary School’s Learning for Life Programme(LLP) is in the Arts. The programmes for the LLP is designed using a 2-pronged approach: Learning Through The Arts (LTTA) and Learning In The Arts(LITA).  It aims to create a vibrant arts culture and environment that enhances teaching and learning, facilitates character development as well as develops students’ mastery in the various aspects of the Arts.

The programme structure is based on a school-based framework – **ACE**.  The acronym ‘**ACE**’ stands for: **_Appreciate, Cultivate_ and _Express_.**

**_Appreciate_** – Broad-based learning through assembly programmes, learning journeys to external performing arts centre, arts museums and music & drama performances.

**_Cultivate_** – Broad-based milestone level enrichment lessons on various visual and performing arts modules and master classes for talent development in the Arts.

**_Express_** – Milestone level performance, performing arts showcase at different levels (i.e. school, zonal & national) and exhibitions.

Based on the three components in the framework, structured activities are planned and mapped out to provide authentic learning experiences for students through varied platforms, exposures and modes of experiences.

In the segment below, we demonstrate how we make use of the ACE framework to encourage and enhance the arts culture and environment in Evergreen Primary School.

### Appreciate

To get students to appreciate the Arts, broad-based learning experiences are planned through assembly programmes, learning journeys to external performing arts centre, arts museums and music & drama performances.
