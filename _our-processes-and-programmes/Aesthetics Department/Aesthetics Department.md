### Aesthetics Department Vision and Mission

**Vision**

Every Student is An Artiste

**Mission**

To nurture, develop and inspire students to instill a strong sense of appreciation for the Arts and self manage their emotions and thoughts through the Arts.

**Aesthetics Department Framework and LLP**

Evergreen Primary School’s Learning for Life Programme(LLP) is in the Arts. The programmes for the LLP is designed using a 2-pronged approach: Learning Through The Arts (LTTA) and Learning In The Arts(LITA).  It aims to create a vibrant arts culture and environment that enhances teaching and learning, facilitates character development as well as develops students’ mastery in the various aspects of the Arts.

The programme structure is based on a school-based framework – **ACE**.  The acronym ‘**ACE**’ stands for: **_Appreciate, Cultivate_ and _Express_.**

**_Appreciate_** – Broad-based learning through assembly programmes, learning journeys to external performing arts centre, arts museums and music & drama performances.

**_Cultivate_** – Broad-based milestone level enrichment lessons on various visual and performing arts modules and master classes for talent development in the Arts.

**_Express_** – Milestone level performance, performing arts showcase at different levels (i.e. school, zonal & national) and exhibitions.

Based on the three components in the framework, structured activities are planned and mapped out to provide authentic learning experiences for students through varied platforms, exposures and modes of experiences.

In the segment below, we demonstrate how we make use of the ACE framework to encourage and enhance the arts culture and environment in Evergreen Primary School.

### Appreciate

To get students to appreciate the Arts, broad-based learning experiences are planned through assembly programmes, learning journeys to external performing arts centre, arts museums and music & drama performances.

**Arts Learning Journeys**  

All Primary 4 pupils visited the Art Museum for a learning experience as part of our school’s Art Museum Based learning Programme in Evergreen Primary School. Students will be involved in Art appreciation and discussion during the trip. Learning from artworks can bring art alive to our students. It not only makes historical or current events visible but piques students’ curiosity and provides them with relevant topics to talk about, and inspires them to make art to express their ideas. Students engage with subject matter of the artworks (i.e. people, places, objects and events) and art forms, and the background ideas and inspiration of artists and their creative work processes.

###  Express
