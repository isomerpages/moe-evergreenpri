Other than Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), our students have successfully used the above areas to apply for Direct School Admission (DSA) to secondary schools as they have had the exposure in these areas and have developed a passion for some that they would like to hone further.

Since the Multi Modal Programme (MMP) provides the **breadth of skills** and exposure for **all** students, the school has decided to provide a narrower range of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) for students who would like to **deepen their interest** and **develop passion and talent** in specific areas such as the 3 Ethnic Dances, Chinese Orchestra, Netball, Football, Badminton, Art Talent Club and Scouts.

Below are some highlights of our students’ experiences in MMP.

### Primary 1 Hip Hop Dance Module

Our primary 1 students were exposed to Hip Hop Dance module during MMP.  Through this programme, we aim to provide a holistic experience where students can appreciate dance as an expressive arts form and participate in an active and healthy physical activity that improve body co-ordination and body awareness.

Students will also learn to be resilient in learning the dance steps - NEVER give up and recognise that dance can help them to relieve stress and regulate thoughts and emotions.

**Primary 2 Home Craft Module**

Our primary 2 students were exposed to Home Craft module during MMP.  Through this programme, we aim to develop students to become self-directed learners who are able to manage themselves by learning lifeskills such as cleaning, folding clothes, making beds and sewing.

### Primary 3 English Drama

Our primary 3 students were exposed to English Drama module during MMP.  Through this programme, we aim to develop students’ expressive repertoire to communicate their ideas, thoughts and feelings through dramatic presentations that are meaningful to themselves and the intended audience and collaborate with others to achieve a shared goal through a performance.
