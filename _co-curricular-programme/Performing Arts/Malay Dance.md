<p>Malay Dance in Evergreen Primary School aims to develop student’s interest
for the traditional art form of the Malay Cultural Dance. Students learn
the fundamental dance movements of the different dance genres mainly Asli,
Inang, Joget, Masri and Zapin. Training sessions will begin with the basic
dance techniques and gradually progressing to advance choreography.</p>
<p>Through learning the dance moves, the students acquire skills such as
flexibility, poise, balance and coordination. Dancers develop resilience,
self – discipline as well as appreciation for culture and the performing
arts.</p>
<p>Our dancers have been given opportunities to showcase their talents during
various school events and celebrations as well as at community events.
We are also regular participants of the Singapore Youth Festivals. By taking
part in these events, students will also develop self-confidence as they
perform on stage and learn to work together as a team.</p>
<p>We hope to provide an enriching learning experience for our students</p>
