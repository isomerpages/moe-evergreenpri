<p>Our Chinese Dance has 25 members. Students joined Chinese Dance out of
their love for dancing and the desire to learn more about this beautiful
art form.</p>
<p>Our dance training focuses on Chinese Dance techniques to develop flexibility
and stamina. Members train and perform as a group, thus fostering bonding
and teamwork. Members are given various opportunities to perform at the
school level, such as Chinese New Year Concert and Achievement Day, as
well as at external events.</p>
