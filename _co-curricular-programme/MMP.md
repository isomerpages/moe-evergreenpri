<p>Other than Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), our students have successfully
used the above areas to apply for Direct School Admission (DSA) to secondary
schools as they have had the exposure in these areas and have developed
a passion for some that they would like to hone further.</p>
<p>Since the Multi Modal Programme (MMP) provides the&nbsp;<strong>breadth of skills</strong>&nbsp;and
exposure for&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;students, the school has decided
to provide a narrower range of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) for students
who would like to&nbsp;<strong>deepen their interest</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>develop passion and talent</strong>&nbsp;in
specific areas such as the 3 Ethnic Dances, Chinese Orchestra, Netball,
Football, Badminton, Art Talent Club and Scouts.</p>
<p>Below are some highlights of our students’ experiences in MMP.</p>
<h3>Primary 1 Hip Hop Dance Module</h3>
<p>Our primary 1 students were exposed to Hip Hop Dance module during MMP.
&nbsp;Through this programme, we aim to&nbsp;provide a holistic experience
where students can appreciate dance as an expressive arts form and participate
in an active and healthy physical activity that improve body co-ordination
and body awareness.</p>
<p>Students will also learn to be resilient in learning the dance steps -
NEVER give up and recognise that dance can help them to relieve stress
and regulate thoughts and emotions.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 2 Home Craft Module</strong>
</p>
<p>Our primary 2 students were exposed to Home Craft module during MMP.&nbsp;
Through this&nbsp;programme, we aim to&nbsp;develop students to become
self-directed learners who are able to manage themselves by learning lifeskills
such as cleaning, folding clothes, making beds and sewing.</p>
