Other than Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), our students have successfully used the above areas to apply for Direct School Admission (DSA) to secondary schools as they have had the exposure in these areas and have developed a passion for some that they would like to hone further.

Since the Multi Modal Programme (MMP) provides the&nbsp;**breadth of skills**&nbsp;and exposure for&nbsp;**all**&nbsp;students, the school has decided to provide a narrower range of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) for students who would like to&nbsp;**deepen their interest**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**develop passion and talent**&nbsp;in specific areas such as the 3 Ethnic Dances, Chinese Orchestra, Netball, Football, Badminton, Art Talent Club and Scouts.

Below are some highlights of our students’ experiences in MMP.

### Primary 1 Hip Hop Dance Module

Our primary 1 students were exposed to Hip Hop Dance module during MMP. &nbsp;Through this programme, we aim to&nbsp;provide a holistic experience where students can appreciate dance as an expressive arts form and participate in an active and healthy physical activity that improve body co-ordination and body awareness.

Students will also learn to be resilient in learning the dance steps - NEVER give up and recognise that dance can help them to relieve stress and regulate thoughts and emotions.

**Primary 2 Home Craft Module**

### Primary 6

Our primary 6 students were exposed to Sports module during MMP.&nbsp; Through this programme, we aim to&nbsp;provide a holistic experience where students can choose to explore from a range of physical activity and sports that are not normally offered in school like fencing, in-line skating, kick boxing, wushu and archery. Students will also get to participate in an active and healthy physical activity.
