<p>EGPS Mass Communication CCA gives students a chance to learn about journalism
and media in a fun and hands-on way. They will pick up useful skills like
researching, writing, and creating content for different types of media.
Through this program, students will also learn how to understand and use
information responsibly while developing a sense of fairness and ethics
in sharing stories.</p>
<p>During the sessions, students will work on projects such as writing news
articles, creating videos, and conducting interviews. These activities
will help them grow in confidence, especially in speaking and presenting
their ideas. Students will be involved in special projects where students
showcase everything they have learnt.</p>
<p>At Mass Communications CCA, students not only develop communication skills
but also foster creativity and critical thinking, preparing them to express
themselves effectively in the future.</p>
