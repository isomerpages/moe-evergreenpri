### Purpose of CCA

CCAs are a key component of students’ holistic education. Through CCAs, students
discover their interests and talents. CCAs also provide platforms for students to develop
their character, learn values, social emotional competencies and other relevant skills to
prepare them for future challenges.
CCAs bring students from diverse backgrounds together. By learning and interacting with
one another, students develop friendships and deepen their sense of belonging to the
school and community.
Students can choose from any of these 4 CCA groups:

• Clubs and Societies<br>
• Physical Sports<br>
• Uniformed Groups<br>
• Visual and Performing Arts

### Learning Outcomes

Students will develop and demonstrate:

* Passion
* Leadership and teamwork
* Friendship and belonging
* Spirit of service to the community
* Knowledge, skills and values related to their chosen CCA
* Core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st century competencies as articulated in the 21st Century Competencies Framework

Since the&nbsp;[Multi-Modal Programme](/our-processes-and-programmes/co-curricular-programme/mmp)&nbsp;(MMP) provides the&nbsp;**breadth of skills**&nbsp;and exposure for&nbsp;**ALL**&nbsp;students, the school has decided to provide a narrower range of CCAs for students who would like to&nbsp;**deepen their interest**&nbsp;in specific areas such as the 3 Ethnic Dances, Percussion Ensemble, Netball, Football, Badminton, Art Talent Club and Scouts.

Our students have also successfully used their experience and exposure in the respective CCAs to apply for DSA to secondary schools and specialised institution like the Sports School and School of The Arts (SOTA).

### **Visual &amp; Performing Arts**

The Performing Arts CCA provide opportunities for students to develop a lifelong passion for the arts.&nbsp;The Performing Arts&nbsp;CCA also nurture students’ creative expression, enrich social, cultural and historical awareness, and build character.

Each of the Performing Arts CCA is distinctive as it comprises its own set of knowledge, skills and attitudes. The four main Learning Outcomes of the Performing Arts CCA are achieved through&nbsp;**Appreciating, Creating, Presenting and Responding**. These Learning Outcomes cover the extent of students’ experiences that their Performing Arts CCA develops them in.

a. In&nbsp;**_Appreciating_**, students are involved in discussing and relating to the value of the respective art form and how this art form applies in their lives and societies across cultures.

b. In&nbsp;**_Creating_**, students participate in activities to apply the art-form skills, techniques and processes.

c. In&nbsp;**_Presenting_**, students will gain the opportunities to put to practice and showcase their skills in the art form.

d. In&nbsp;**_Responding_**, students will learn to think critically and show confidence in their ability to make judgements of art works using vocabulary that is appropriate and representative of the art form.

### **Uniformed Group**  

Uniformed Groups (UG) provide students with authentic learning experiences which will help them develop important qualities such as leadership, teamwork and resilience.&nbsp;The Uniformed Group (UG) activities aim to make good citizens of students by inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to others.

The Uniformed Group sessions are designed with the following in mind:

a.&nbsp;**Core Curricula**

This encompasses the skills, knowledge and attitudes that the student would learn in his/her particular UG;

b.&nbsp;**Competitions, Events, Visits, etc.**

These encompass the various competitions or events that the student would be involved in;

c.&nbsp;**School-Based Initiatives**

These encompass the various initiatives and duties schools may require of students in UGs. Examples include ushering or yeoman duties during school functions;

d.&nbsp;**Training/Activity and Learning Objectives**

Activities are planned with the students' learning and development of knowledge, skills and values in mind. This ensures a meaningful and holistic CCA experience for the students.

### **Clubs and Societies**

Clubs and Societies allow students to explore and extend their interests in wide ranging and specialised areas which may be knowledge-based or skills-based. Students are honed in information, communication and technical skills as they strive to grow their mastery of the specialized areas.
