### Purpose of CCA

The CCA Programme provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents. Students progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups. CCA also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies.

### Learning Outcomes

Students will develop and demonstrate:

* Passion
* Leadership and teamwork
* Friendship and belonging
* Spirit of service to the community
* Knowledge, skills and values related to their chosen CCA
* Core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st century competencies as articulated in the 21st Century Competencies Framework

Since the [Multi-Modal Programme](/our-processes-and-programmes/co-curricular-programme/mmp) (MMP) provides the **breadth of skills** and exposure for **ALL** students, the school has decided to provide a narrower range of CCAs for students who would like to **deepen their interest** in specific areas such as the 3 Ethnic Dances, Chinese Orchestra, Netball, Football, Badminton, Art Talent Club and Scouts which have been producing outstanding results over the years.

Our students have also successfully used their experience and exposure in the respective CCAs to apply for DSA to secondary schools and specialised institution like the Sports School and School of The Arts (SOTA).

### **Visual & Performing Arts**

The Performing Arts CCA provide opportunities for students to develop a lifelong passion for the arts. The Performing Arts CCA also nurture students’ creative expression, enrich social, cultural and historical awareness, and build character.

Each of the Performing Arts CCA is distinctive as it comprises its own set of knowledge, skills and attitudes. The four main Learning Outcomes of the Performing Arts CCA are achieved through **Appreciating, Creating, Presenting and Responding**. These Learning Outcomes cover the extent of students’ experiences that their Performing Arts CCA develops them in.

a. In **_Appreciating_**, students are involved in discussing and relating to the value of the respective art form and how this art form applies in their lives and societies across cultures.

b. In **_Creating_**, students participate in activities to apply the art-form skills, techniques and processes.

c. In **_Presenting_**, students will gain the opportunities to put to practice and showcase their skills in the art form.

d. In **_Responding_**, students will learn to think critically and show confidence in their ability to make judgements of art works using vocabulary that is appropriate and representative of the art form.
