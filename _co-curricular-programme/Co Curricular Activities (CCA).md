<h3>Purpose of CCA</h3>
<p>CCAs are a key component of students’ holistic education. Through CCAs,
students discover their interests and talents. CCAs also provide platforms
for students to develop their character, learn values, social emotional
competencies and other relevant skills to prepare them for future challenges.
CCAs bring students from diverse backgrounds together. By learning and
interacting with one another, students develop friendships and deepen their
sense of belonging to the school and community. Students can choose from
any of these 4 CCA groups:</p>
<p>• Clubs and Societies
<br>• Physical Sports
<br>• Uniformed Groups
<br>• Visual and Performing Arts</p>
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>Students will develop and demonstrate:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Passion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leadership and teamwork</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Friendship and belonging</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spirit of service to the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge, skills and values related to their chosen CCA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st century
competencies as articulated in the 21st Century Competencies Framework</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the&nbsp;<a href="/our-processes-and-programmes/co-curricular-programme/mmp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Multi-Modal Programme</a>&nbsp;(MMP)
provides the&nbsp;<strong>breadth of skills</strong>&nbsp;and exposure
for&nbsp;<strong>ALL</strong>&nbsp;students, the school has decided to
provide a narrower range of CCAs for students who would like to&nbsp;<strong>deepen their interest</strong>&nbsp;in
specific areas such as the 3 Ethnic Dances, Percussion Ensemble, Netball,
Football, Badminton, Art Talent Club and Scouts.</p>
<p>Our students have also successfully used their experience and exposure
in the respective CCAs to apply for DSA to secondary schools and specialised
institution like the Sports School and School of The Arts (SOTA).</p>
<h3><strong>Performing Arts</strong></h3>
<p>The Performing Arts CCA provide opportunities for students to develop
a lifelong passion for the arts.&nbsp;The Performing Arts&nbsp;CCA also
nurture students’ creative expression, enrich social, cultural and historical
awareness, and build character.</p>
<p>Each of the Performing Arts CCA is distinctive as it comprises its own
set of knowledge, skills and attitudes. The four main Learning Outcomes
of the Performing Arts CCA are achieved through&nbsp;<strong>Appreciating, Creating, Presenting and Responding</strong>.
These Learning Outcomes cover the extent of students’ experiences that
their Performing Arts CCA develops them in.</p>
<p>a. In&nbsp;<strong><em>Appreciating</em></strong>, students are involved
in discussing and relating to the value of the respective art form and
how this art form applies in their lives and societies across cultures.</p>
<p>b. In&nbsp;<strong><em>Creating</em></strong>, students participate in
activities to apply the art-form skills, techniques and processes.</p>
<p>c. In&nbsp;<strong><em>Presenting</em></strong>, students will gain the
opportunities to put to practice and showcase their skills in the art form.</p>
<p>d. In&nbsp;<strong><em>Responding</em></strong>, students will learn to
think critically and show confidence in their ability to make judgements
of art works using vocabulary that is appropriate and representative of
the art form.</p>

<h3><strong>Uniformed Group</strong></h3>
<p>Uniformed Groups (UG) provide students with authentic learning experiences
which will help them develop important qualities such as leadership, teamwork
and resilience.&nbsp;The Uniformed Group (UG) activities aim to make good
citizens of students by inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience,
discipline and a spirit of service to others.</p>
<p>The Uniformed Group sessions are designed with the following in mind:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;<strong>Core Curricula</strong>
</p>
<p>This encompasses the skills, knowledge and attitudes that the student
would learn in his/her particular UG;</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;<strong>Competitions, Events, Visits, etc.</strong>
</p>
<p>These encompass the various competitions or events that the student would
be involved in;</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;<strong>School-Based Initiatives</strong>
</p>
<p>These encompass the various initiatives and duties schools may require
of students in UGs. Examples include ushering or yeoman duties during school
functions;</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;<strong>Training/Activity and Learning Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>Activities are planned with the students' learning and development of
knowledge, skills and values in mind. This ensures a meaningful and holistic
CCA experience for the students.</p>
