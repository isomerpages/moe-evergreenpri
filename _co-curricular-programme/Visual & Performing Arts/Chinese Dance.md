** Teacher I/C:  	Mdm Kee Wai Ying **	

Our Chinese Dance has 25 members. Students joined Chinese Dance out of their love for
dancing and the desire to learn more about this beautiful art form.

Our dance training focuses on Chinese Dance techniques to develop flexibility and
stamina. Members train and perform as a group, thus fostering bonding and teamwork.
Members are given various opportunities to perform at the school level, such as Chinese
New Year Concert and Achievement Day, as well as at external events.
