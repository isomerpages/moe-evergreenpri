The Indian Dance CCA in Evergreen Primary was established to provide students with an opportunity and platform to appreciate the fine aesthetics of Indian dance and culture. We welcome students of all races and we seek to instil in them a passion for dance and an appreciation for the Arts. Under the expertise of our talented instructor, Ms Bavani Singh, our dancers have been able to explore and develop their passions and talents for this cultural art form.  
  
Through regular training, dancers not only hone their dance skills and chorography 

but also develop a deeper sense of self-confidence and cultural identity and have grown into a close-knit group of highly committed dancers. 

Apart from preforming at school events, Evergreen Primary’s Indian Dance has also been invited to perform at several public events. It was a great honour for the team to perform at the National Day celebration at Sembawang CC in 2018 as well as the Illuminate@Kampung Admiralty in 2019. We constantly look for opportunities to groom our students into confident and competent dancers.
