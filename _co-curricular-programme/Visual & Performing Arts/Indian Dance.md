The Indian Dance CCA in Evergreen Primary seeks to provide students with a platform to explore the fine aesthetics of Indian dance and culture.&nbsp;

We welcome students of all races from Primary 2 to Primary 6 and seek to instil within them a passion for the Arts.

Under the expertise of our talented instructor, Ms Bavani Singh, our dancers have been able to explore various genres of Indian dance such as folk, classical and contemporary dance.&nbsp;

Through regular training, our dancers not only hone their dance skills and choreography but also develop a deeper sense of self-confidence and cultural awareness.&nbsp;

Apart from performing at school events, Evergreen Primaryâ€™s Indian Dance has also been invited to perform at several external events. It was a great honour for the team to perform at the National Day celebration at Sembawang CC back in 2018 as well as the Illuminate@Kampung Admiralty in 2019. We constantly look for opportunities to develop our students into confident and competent dancers.

Many of our alumni have excelled in the art form and have been selected under the DSA programme for admission to various secondary schools. This is a testament to the holistic development the CCA offers.
