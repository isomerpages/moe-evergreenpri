Evergreen Primary School’s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and
Environmental Club seeks to groom innovative, enthusiastic and ethical youth who demonstrate
appreciation for the environment around them and its conservation. 

Through weekly sessions, members
are trained in skills required for inquiry-based learning and creative problem solving. At the same time,
we aim to impart the joy of learning and help members to apply their learning into real-life situations.
Middle block members will be learning basic programming using Scratch, while Upper Block members
will learn intermediate-level programming with Mbots. 

Members will also learn concepts of
sustainability and environmental conservation through hands-on activities and learning journeys. They
will then apply what they have learnt in programming help in conservation efforts, for example,
designing Artificial Intelligence that can sort recyclables.
