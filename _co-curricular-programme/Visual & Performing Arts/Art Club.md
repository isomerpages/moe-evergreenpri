Art Talent Club is an inclusive Visual Art CCA which recruits members from Primary 2 to Primary 6 who are passionate in upgrading their aesthetic skills and knowledge. We encourage members to mingle among each other from various levels, make mistakes during the process of art-making, learn to be innovative and creative through our art thinking routine discussions and collaborative projects.

Members will undergo through various art enrichments conducted by Art Specialists; participate in local and international art competitions so as to gain exposure in regards to their artworks. They will also be developed in terms of their leadership capabilities such as being confident speakers and leading in group discussions, contribute back to the community through Art Outreach and be the art ambassadors for the school.

Through our various aesthetics programs, we hope to mould our members into confident and active contributors to the society through the arts.

* Our Mission: Unique Individuals, Various Talents.
* Our Vision: To spread positivity with our heARTs.
