<p>EGPS Basketball CCA brings together students who love the game, whether
they enjoy friendly play or competitive matches. In this CCA, students
will learn the fundamental skills of basketball, including dribbling, shooting,
passing, and ball-handling. They will also develop physical fitness and
learn proper warm-up and cool-down routines through regular training.</p>
<p>Students will be introduced to basic game tactics and strategies, developing
critical thinking and problem-solving skills as they analyse game situations
and adapt their approach during matches. They will have opportunities to
participate in friendly matches and competitions with other schools organised
by our teachers-in-charge, where they learn to communicate effectively
with teammates and demonstrate sportsmanship across diverse school communities.</p>
<p>As basketball is a team sport, our CCA goes beyond physical skills. Students
enhance their collaboration and leadership abilities whilst learning to
support teammates. We emphasise character development, discipline, and
important values such as resilience, integrity, teamwork, and respect in
every player.</p>
<p>Through basketball, students build self-confidence, develop emotional
regulation under pressure, and learn to reflect on their performance for
continuous improvement. Our CCA nurtures responsible citizens who demonstrate
civic-mindedness both on and off the court, preparing them with essential
life skills for the future.</p>
