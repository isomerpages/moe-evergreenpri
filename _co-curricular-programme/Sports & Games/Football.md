EVERGREEN FOOTBALL CCA

The Evergreen Primary Football CCA caters to students of all playing levels, from a budding beginner who wants to learn to kick a football, to those who wants to improve their skills to become better players. This CCA aims to not only develop our members physically but holistically as well. We believe that Football is not only just about matches and winnings, it is about developing our students’ character and sportsmanship by inculcating our school values and mission during the training sessions. Our training aims to give the students the opportunity to discover their own interests and talents as well as developing their own skills.

During the suspension of face-to-face CCA sessions, we adopted a synchronous E-CCA session using platforms such as SLS and ZOOM. These E-CCA sessions allow the students to continue to hone not only their individual set of skills but also, the cognitive aspect of football by learning the technical aspect and tactics through game analysis
