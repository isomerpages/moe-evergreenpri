The Evergreen Primary Football CCA caters to students of all playing levels, from a budding beginner who want to learn to kick a football, to those who wants to improve their skills to become better players. This CCA aims to not only develop our members physically but holistically as well. We believe that Football is not only about winning, it is about developing our students’ characters, sportsmanship and discipline.
