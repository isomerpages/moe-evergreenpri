EGPS Badminton CCA provides students with the opportunity to learn basic skills and techniques of the sport such as serving, lobbing, netting, smashing and footwork. Students will also have the opportunity to represent the school in the annual North Zone Primary Schools Badminton Championships. We also organise Intra-team school-based competitions in Term 4 for the students from the various levels to take part. It will serve as a platform for students as an exposure to competition settings to compete in a non-threatening environment and grow to become better players. 

Through participation in the Badminton CCA, our students get the opportunity to demonstrate our school values such as Respect, Empathy, Grit, Graciousness and Integrity through the activities planned during CCA.
