Taekwondo or TKD for short is a new sport CCA at Evergreen Primary School. Taekwondo comprises of the words, "Tae" "Kwon" "Do." It is composed of three parts as shown in the English spelling, though it is one word in Korean. "Tae" means "foot," "leg," or "to step on"; "Kwon" means "fist," or "fight"; and "Do" means the "way" or "discipline." If we put these three parts together, we can see two important concepts behind "Tae Kwon Do" which is to perform these hand and leg movements in a discipline manner. This will be the guiding principle in our CCA.

As such our CCA strives:

* To develop an appreciation of Taekwondo as a sport and as an art
* To inculcate the school values respect, empathy, grit, graciousness and integrity in members  through Taekwondo
* To provide students with optimum opportunities to develop their potential and achieve top placing in all divisions in NSG

At EGPS, our TKD members are taught that taekwondo is an art and sport, which requires both mental and physical discipline. We focus on values, training and leadership. This CCA develops students’ confidence and good sportsmanship as they prepare for grading and competitions. We also welcome belted students (meaning students who have taken up TKD outside) and would like to contribute to our CCA.

Our head coach, Mr Ng Tian Huat Tony, whom have taken part in many international events and represented Singapore in many occasions will be coaching our TKD members. Together with the teachers in TKD, we will ensure a holistic development of our students.
