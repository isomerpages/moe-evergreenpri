Taekwondo or TKD for short is a new sports CCA at Evergreen Primary School. It commenced in the year 2022. It is a very popular CCA and well-liked by our students. By  the end of Semester 1, we were able to recruit new members into our CCA. We now have a strong membership of 68 members. 



TKD CCA strives:

•	To develop an appreciation for Taekwondo as a Sport and an Art 

•	To inculcate the school values of respect, empathy, grit, graciousness and integrity in members through Taekwondo

•	To provide students with optimum opportunities to develop their potential and achieve top 8 placing in all divisions in NSG

At EGPS, our TKD members are taught that Taekwondo is a Sport and an Art which requires  mental and physical discipline to master the  pattern formation as well as skills. We focus on values, training and leadership. This CCA develops students’ confidence and good sportsmanship as they prepare themselves for grading and competitions. In our CCA, students will be introduced to the rules of Taekwondo and various patterns at their belt level. Students will also get to understand why Taekwondo is both a Martial Art and Sport.

Our head coach, Mr Ng Tian Huat Tony, has taken part in many international events as well as represented Singapore on many occasions. He will be coaching our TKD members. Together with the teachers in TKD, we will ensure a holistic development for our students and celebrate their success and growth.
