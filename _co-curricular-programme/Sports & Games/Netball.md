<p><strong><em>What is Netball training like in EGPS?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Our training involves basic ball skills, stamina building, agility and
coordination exercises under the close supervision of our coach and teachers-in-charge
in the school’s Indoor Sports Hall.</p>
<p>Our training aims to develop every player to the best of her potential
through active participation and good strong foundation of Netball basic
skills.&nbsp;Netball provides a unique opportunity for both physical and
character building. Students will be able to adopt an attitude of fair
play and good sportsmanship through the pursuit of continuous improvement
of their physical, psychological and social skills. Netball is a team sport,
thus, our students learn to cooperate successfully to attack, defend and
score goals.</p>
<p>During the suspension of CCA due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our girls had
their trainings via ZOOM and SLS platforms. This allowed them to maintain
their stamina and build continuous camaraderie among the students.</p>
