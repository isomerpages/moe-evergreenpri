_**What is Netball training like in EGPS?**_

Our training involves basic ball skills, stamina building, agility and coordination exercises under the close supervision of our coach and teachers-in-charge in the schoolâ€™s Indoor Sports Hall.

Our training aims to develop every player to the best of her potential through active participation and good strong foundation of Netball basic skills.&nbsp;Netball provides a unique opportunity for both physical and character building. Students will be able to adopt an attitude of fair play and good sportsmanship through the pursuit of continuous improvement of their physical, psychological and social skills. Netball is a team sport, thus, our students learn to cooperate successfully to attack, defend and score goals.

During the suspension of CCA due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our girls had their trainings via ZOOM and SLS platforms. This allowed them to maintain their stamina and build continuous camaraderie among the students.
