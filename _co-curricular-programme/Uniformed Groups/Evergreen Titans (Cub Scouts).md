Evergreen Primary School Scouts is also known as Evergreen Titans. During our CCA sessions, we provide students with authentic learning experiences which will help them develop important qualities as such as leadership, teamwork and resilience. The activities that are carried out also aim to make good citizens of students by inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to others. The Scout Method of training and activities also help students make a personal commitment to a simple code of living through the value system based on the Scout Promise and Law.
