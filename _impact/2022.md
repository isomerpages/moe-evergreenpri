Speaking Programme – Story Telling Competition

Mythos 2022 is a nation-wide story telling competition organized by Anglo-Chinese Junior College. Students were required to showcase their flair in dramatic speaking through storytelling in the various rounds. We had two students who represented our school. 

We are pleased to share that receiving the certificate of participation, we have Kate Chua from 5 Grace. Out of  all the 142 participants, we are thrilled to share that coming in first place we have Dashnelle Nishan Pillai from 5 Charity. She was also awarded with the Best Costume award.
